			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We spent the majority of this week scoring bids from interested suppliers and I'm pleased to announce we have selected one and we'll award a contract to them first thing next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our evaluation panel met on Monday and reviewed paper submissions which included outline plans for project delivery, details of resources being deployed, pricing and experience of runnning similar projects to equally tight deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met with each supplier's teams to discuss their proposals both in person and virtually which helped to firm up our evaluations and get an understanding of how their paper submissions translated to real world practical activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended the week with a real sense of confidence that we'll be able to deliver a meaningful discovery over the remaining 9 weeks of the project (accepting that 2 of those weeks are over the Christmas break).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In readiness for a project kick off next week, we've secured a collaboration space in our &lt;a href="https://www.barnsleydmc.co.uk"&gt;Digital Media Centre&lt;/a&gt; large enough to seat 7 people comfortably, with media services (Wi-Fi, screens, etc.) and importantly with walls for sticking things to! This is a lockable space that we can set up and leave, to use as we need. Huge thank you to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cr8tveBarnsley"&gt;Tracey Johnson&lt;/a&gt; for that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to next week, we're meeting first thing Monday morning and will look to award the contract to the winning bidder as soon as possible. We'll confirm with them the date for our project kick-off and update the project team about when and where that will take place. We'll also need to confirm the agenda but I suspect that will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recap of the previous work carried out by NELC and the GOV.UK Pay team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A review of our project and it’s vision, goals and risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A look at our timeline and outline project plan to January 31st&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A discussion about how we can best work together as a project team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next steps – planning for our first sprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're really looking forward to getting into the meat of it now.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The submission window on our tender process closed this week and paperwork is being pulled together for review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The submission window on our tender process closed this week and paperwork is being pulled together for review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week will see a tender pack delivered to us and the team here in Barnsley will evaluate them. Towards the end of the week, we'll meet suppliers and discuss their submissions in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invitation for our bid partners to join us at both of those events is open, either to join us on-site here in Barnsley or remotely where we can facilitate it.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 7</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-7</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our requirements remain published for a period of 14 days and organisations are invited to submit against them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our requirements remain published for a period of 14 days and organisations are invited to submit against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team in Barnsley have held clarification calls with several interested parties so far across the week and we're encouraged by the conversations we've been having. All the questions asked of us have been noted along with our answers and are being shared openly on our YorTender portal. This will help to make sure all the submissions we receive are as appropriate as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say too much about how many suppliers we've spoken with, or who they are as the whole process is confidential by nature, but I am keen to be as open as possible, hence still releasing this shorter blog post this week about how we're progressing just generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm on leave next week but I expect to be continuing to receive and answer questions via the  portal throughout. When I return, the tender window will have closed and the team here in Barnsley will be reviewing those submissions w/c 4th November. I've invited our partners to join us in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppliers will visit us to discuss their submissions in more detail on November 8th. Again, I've issued an invite to all partners to join us in that on-site here in Barnsley, or remotely where we can support that - keen to have as much involvement as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm conscious we still need to figure out how we're going to work together as a bid team. At the moment Barnsley continue to lead these early activities and are inviting support and comment at each stage. To that end the agile training hasn't been organised yet but is on our task list of things to do so isn't lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next weeks post may be a few days late as I catch up w/c 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 6</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-6</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our requirements are published. Not on the &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/"&gt;Digital Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; as we first intended, but rather via &lt;a href="https://www.yortender.co.uk/"&gt;YORTender&lt;/a&gt;, our usual route for obtaining quotes and securing suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our requirements are published. Not on the &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/"&gt;Digital Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; as we first intended, but rather via &lt;a href="https://www.yortender.co.uk/"&gt;YORTender&lt;/a&gt;, our usual route for obtaining quotes and securing suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've opted to take this route based on guidance from our corporate procurement team - the long and short of it being that our organisation doesn't currently use the Digital Marketplace and we have established processes for working with YORtender already - so it makes the whole thing run a lot more smoothly for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be out to market from October 16th to October 30th and will have awarded by Friday 8th November 2019. We intend to kick off delivery on Monday, November 11th. That revises our anticipated timeline from &lt;a href="/20190920"&gt;Week 2&lt;/a&gt; to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 01-09: Procure delivery partner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 10-18: Run investigative workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 19-20: Document outputs into reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting that w/c 23rd December and 30th December will be cut short by the Christmas and New Year break, our 8 week investigative period is only a little over 6 weeks. We'll need to be a bit more savvy with our procurement activities if we make future bids to the fund as the balance is a little off for my liking. Still, it is our first rodeo and we're learning a lot of lessons here that I hope others will appreciate as I keep blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've setup evaluation, award and project kick off meetings with our internal stakeholders already and I've invited our bid partners to join us in those as of late last night - that can be on site (we love to host) or remotely (which was a major consideration in our bid application - that partners wanted to support remotely wherever possible). They'll get copies of bidders documents on November 4th for review and comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I'm looking at booking our team onto the Agile for Teams course with the GDS Academy. As a successful bidder to the fund, we're entitled to take up that offer. I've sent invites to our partners and hope to hear back from them shortly for a session November 5th, 6th and 7th if that will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we do need to do as a team still is figure out how we're going to work together across the duration of the project. For the timebeing, Barnsley are leading these early activities and inviting support and comment wherever practical. We may continue in that way and as such the agile training may not be necessary but I don't want to close the doors on the chance to work more closely together and certainly that's in the sprit of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll post again next week with more information.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 5</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-5</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We revised and published &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;our draft requirements for a Digital Outcome&lt;/a&gt; this week and then promptly withdrew them!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
			<guid>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-5</guid>
			<pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We revised and published &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;our draft requirements for a Digital Outcome&lt;/a&gt; this week and then promptly withdrew them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out we published our earlier draft requirements that were asking for a Digital Specialist, rather than the latest version that asks for a Digital Outcome. As a result, all of the questions we received seemed irrelevant or confused - in fact, some of them were more statements advising we ask for an outcome, which we thought we had!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we pulled them again today and we plan to regroup and go out again next week. Apologies to anyone who submitted a question or showed an interest in the work. We do still require support and we will be back shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, we're looking for an organisation to run our Discovery project. To marshall our stakeholders and carry out user research workshops with them. To document findings into a business/benefits case, a user research report, a conclusion and if appropriate, a funding bid to the Local Digital Fund to proceed with an Alpha project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally the succesful organisation will bring at least one: user researcher, service designer, product owner, delivery manager to get us to that point within the timescales set out by the fund - 31st January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've listed our user stories as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Barnsley IM Product Owner, I need to understand the changes required to it to meet national user needs so I can develop it such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an LA Income Manager, I need to know if my needs will be met and the savings I can make, so that I can consider migrating over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a GOV.UK Pay Product Owner, I need to understand the changes required for integration so I can develop such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an LA ICT manager, I need to know how the solution will be packaged so that I understand how to implement and support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's much more detail in the Google Sheet linked above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our stakeholders, bear with us please - we'll be out with our requirements again next week and will be looking to shortlist providers very soon after that. I'll be in touch with dates as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note, to thank Egle at MHCLG for all her support to date, and to Tony Evans for his comments on our requirements as they were being revised. we've found your input extremely useful so thank you for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope next week to be posting less about procurement and more about delivery. Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 4</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-4</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Week 4 was what I'm going to refer to as procurement week! Having engaged our Contracts &amp;amp; Commissioning Team in &lt;a href="/20190920"&gt;week 2&lt;/a&gt;, they've subsequently involved our Corporate Procurement Team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
			<guid>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-4</guid>
			<pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Week 4 was what I'm going to refer to as procurement week! Having engaged our Contracts &amp;amp; Commissioning Team in &lt;a href="/20190920"&gt;week 2&lt;/a&gt;, they've subsequently involved our Corporate Procurement Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind that is that the value of the contract we're looking to award will be over £70K and so presumably that hits some sort of internal trigger. So, I've been engaged with Corporate Procurment for most of the week completing various document templates that outline the project and the need for us to bring in support. So far, I've completed and returned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procurement Event Approval Document for Research Consultant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Officer Decisions Recording Process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Privacy Impact Assessment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our colleagues in Corporate Procurement are taking the information from those documents to complete their own work and get our requirements uploaded to the Digital Marketplace - I'm hoping that happens really soon as time is ticking away quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that I'm afraid there's been little progress. I mentioned in &lt;a href="/20190927"&gt;last week's lessons&lt;/a&gt; that the day job doesn't just immediately stop and true to that I've been swamped in other business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent 2 days in Bridlington at the &lt;a href="https://www.humbercaretech.co.uk"&gt;Humber Care Tech Challenge&lt;/a&gt; with a 5 person team that I'd pulled together, looking at how we could help sufferers of dementia and their carers. That was a really worthwhile event and I hope to attend future ones. I'll blog about that seperately though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to week 5.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 3</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-3</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As week three draws to a close we complete &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;our draft requirements for a Digital Outcome&lt;/a&gt; and prepare to publish them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As week three draws to a close we complete &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;our draft requirements for a Digital Outcome&lt;/a&gt; and prepare to publish them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't taken the time to carry out early market engagement simply because there isn't much time available. That might come back to bite us, but we'll see how we get on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also spent some time reviewing the learning I took when I visited the Local Digital Fund Workshop in London on the 11th. I paid particular attention during the fishbowl discussions when previous discovery projects were highlighting what had worked well and not so well during their work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobilising the project team is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;! The day job doesn't just stop. Get to people early. Speak to them. Prepare them. The project is coming, they need to be ready. They may need to move other work. This can takes weeks! Consider your enablers - your IT team, your FM team, your HR team, your web providers, your infrastructure team - anyone who, if not ready, could cause a problem. Speak to them. Prepare them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare the rest of your organisation. Blog. Send emails. Run awareness sessions. Use the phrase &amp;quot;a condition of the fund...&amp;quot; lots of times. The project will struggle if you need someone unexpectedly and they aren't aware of the project, it's value and it's tight timeline. If your organisation has a staff newsletter, get in it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up your communication channels now so they're ready. If your using YouTube for Sprint Reviews, do you have an account? Does your organisation have a channel? Are you allowed to use that channel? Do you need to set up a new blog? Can you use your organisations Twitter account?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the above is about communication! It's key! Engage your communications team early and start getting messages out now! In all communications, be clear about what it is the project will be doing, who it might need to involve, and what it hopes to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If communications trigger any new interest from stakeholders, grab them with both hands and find a way to utilise them if at all possible. The more information that can be gleaned in a Discovery project, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engage your Contracts / Commissioning / Procurement teams. Chances are, given this project is funded, you'll be spending money. Make sure there are arrangements in place for that to be done quickly, effectively and within all procurement rules and guidelines. Last thing you need is to be dealing with a procurement issue in the middle of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secure a project space - get onto your FM team and secure a room for the duration of the project. You are going to need it, if only to have a quiet space to conduct user research interviews. If it doesn't have conferencing facilities, see if you can get hold of a speaker phone at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you can access tools like Trello, YouTube, Google Docs - some IT teams will block them. Not all of your partner organisations will use Microsoft Word and sometimes you'll have to share in a more open collaborative way. Have a word - make sure you have a way to together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factor in public holidays! This project will run over Christmas/New Year week - don't expect to have that time available. Sounds obvious, but it's a week less than you think you have before you've even started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are there any significant management structure changes happening in the organisation that could change the key stakeholders in your plan. What about in your partner organisations - does anyone know? Can you prepare for any of that now in advance so you're not caught out and can react if it does happen? Contact your partners - have that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be honest with your stakeholders, especially the people you're carrying out user research with that you appreciate their effort and that (hopefully not) it might come to nothing. Don't give them unrealistic expectations that their work will individually save £1m for example. Be open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be acting on all of these advice points next week! In the meantime I've already begun blogging regularly (weekly) both internally within our organisation and &lt;a href="https://kingstonrichard.uk"&gt;externally&lt;/a&gt;. This should help with a lot of the above and help keep the narrative going with partners as we progress.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 2</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-2</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We're making good progress mobilising our internal team to run &lt;a href="https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/09/12/the-6-projects-funded-in-round-2-of-the-local-digital-fund/"&gt;our Discovery project&lt;/a&gt; and in the interests of working in the open I wanted to quickly share some details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We're making good progress mobilising our internal team to run &lt;a href="https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/09/12/the-6-projects-funded-in-round-2-of-the-local-digital-fund/"&gt;our Discovery project&lt;/a&gt; and in the interests of working in the open I wanted to quickly share some details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've engaged our internal Contracts &amp;amp; Commissioning team to support our application to the &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/"&gt;Digital Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. We'll be making use of the &lt;a href="https://digitalmarketplace.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/27/digital-outcomes-and-specialists-an-overview/"&gt;Digital Specialist and Outcomes framework&lt;/a&gt; to secure a Delivery Manager. Our intent here is to work with someone who is familiar with running discovery projects to both run this project and educate our team to be able to run future ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel to this, some of our internal team attended the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/agile-for-teams-course-description"&gt;GDS Agile for Teams&lt;/a&gt; workshop a couple of weeks ago and we're running a seperate Discovery project with them. Both of these exercises should give us a good handle on how to change the way we work for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've re-read through the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-digital-fund-prospectus-2019-to-2020"&gt;Local Digital Fund Prospectus 2019/20&lt;/a&gt; and noted the project outputs are due at the end of January 2020. That's 20 weeks from the date of the award. Assuming 4-6 weeks to secure a delivery manager, that leaves us up to 16 weeks for the delivery itself. I'm breaking that down as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 01-06: Procure delivery manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 07-15: Run investigative workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 16-20: Document outputs into reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously that will break down into a more granular plan over time, but that's the aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll share links to all of our documentation, starting with our marketplace requirements shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>£80,000 of Local Digital Funding approved</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-local-digital-funding-approved</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday came &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kingstonrichard/status/1172140492051636224"&gt;the official announcement&lt;/a&gt; that we'd been awarded the maximum £80,000 from the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/fund/"&gt;Local Digital Fund&lt;/a&gt; to progress the rollout of our income management system, nationally!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday came &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kingstonrichard/status/1172140492051636224"&gt;the official announcement&lt;/a&gt; that we'd been awarded the maximum £80,000 from the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/fund/"&gt;Local Digital Fund&lt;/a&gt; to progress the rollout of our income management system, nationally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4EPlTWphcculCRcoeXt-2leX4F8AGTL2XGG9sBE9P4"&gt;our bid to the fund&lt;/a&gt; back in August, on the premise that the income management function within council's was uncessarily burdened by legacy software products and that our in-house development could make a real difference as it has done in Barnsley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We proposed to spend some money investigating the claim that by allowing other council's to use our system they too could save time and money as we have - and that those savings, when scaled nationally, would add up significantly for the public sector as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money is effectively awarded to us on a speculate to accumulate basis - the idea that by spending £80K now, we can potentially save hundreds of thousands of pounds from the public purse overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, over the coming weeks and months we'll be running a Discovery project that will research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether there is a market for an alternative Income Management system to those legacy products already out there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are the user needs for a good Income Management product amongst local authorities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether our income management system meets the needs of other council's or have we built it too specific to our needs and set up - what do they need that we haven't thought about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether changes can be made to our income management system where gaps are identified in it meeting the user needs of other councils - what might those changes be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether our income management system can integrate successfully with GOV.UK Pay to offer a more holistic solution for accepting income and then processing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if an income management system could be built and shared within the public sector, what is the best way to ensure a cost-effective, well-supported solution for council's?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing this, we are the lead in a collaboration of 6 council's (Barnsley, Sheffield, Allerdale, Cherwell &amp;amp; South Northamptonshire, North East Lincolnshire and Huntingdonshire) and the GOV.UK Pay Product Team. There's also keen interest from West Berkshire, Hackney and Oxfordshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first step will be to recruit a delivery manager - someone familiar with running Discovery projects within the guidance set out by the conditions of the fund. They'll produce all the necessary documentation and coordinate research workshops with key stakeholders in our partner organisations over a 12 week period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect it'll take us 4-6 weeks to source that person and so we should be seeing results from the project early in the New Year. Watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>We've branded our "Digi" series</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who helped us &lt;a href="/20190402"&gt;name the first three prototypes&lt;/a&gt; that we produced in our Innovation Group. Digi"NAME" was the format we ultimately settled on, giving us DigiBook, DigiDesk and DigiMeet so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who helped us &lt;a href="/20190402"&gt;name the first three prototypes&lt;/a&gt; that we produced in our Innovation Group. Digi&amp;quot;NAME&amp;quot; was the format we ultimately settled on, giving us DigiBook, DigiDesk and DigiMeet so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This naming format ties in nicely with our Digital First initiative and gives us a nice model to follow in the future. We're already working on a DigiSafe prototype and there are other ideas in the pipeline that suit too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, we set our friendly neighbourhood web designer Aidan Minton (who happens to be a qualified Graphic Designer) to work creating a branding proposal around the &amp;quot;Digi&amp;quot; concept and here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-06-digibook-branding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiBook branding" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-06-digidesk-branding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiDesk branding" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-06-digimeet-branding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiMeet branding" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of the concept here is that we can simply change the colour and &lt;NAME&gt; element to suit any new prototype we develop without needing hours of work to produce a new brand each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're looking next into the possibility of registering a trademark around the naming convention and securing domain names for any marketing / sales websites we might associate with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards and upwards!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>DigiDesk v3 is alive!</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digidesk-v3-is-alive</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we've completed the breadboard development of DigiDesk v3 and it works an absolute treat!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
			<guid>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digidesk-v3-is-alive</guid>
			<pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today we've completed the breadboard development of DigiDesk v3 and it works an absolute treat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPXpI4ZLL34"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/EPXpI4ZLL34/0.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Desk Occupancy Monitor v3.0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've set up a demo desk in our maker space at the Barnsley DMC with a keyboard, mouse, screen, desk lamp, and printer. Ideally we'd have had a second screen and a dock rather than a lamp and a printer but this represents a similar level of power usage to our typical office desk setup, so it's all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick scan of any council ID badge instructs the device to communicate with a central dashboard over Wi-Fi, register the desk as occupied and turn on the power to it. You'll see in the video that the screen, printer and lamp all kick into life. A second quick scan of a badge instructs the device to &amp;quot;de-register&amp;quot; the desk and switch off the power. You'll see that everything switches off almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of a lag with it at the moment which is due to the time it takes the device to register/de-register the desk, then re-check the status of the desk. It rechecks to make sure the registration has succeeded, as opposed to just assuming it has. If it were to assume it had when it actually hadn't, the device would end up out of sync and it would end up switching power off when it should be on and vice versa. We plan to speed that up though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we've been working on this, as I mentioned in &lt;a href="/20190626"&gt;my last DigiDesk post&lt;/a&gt;, we've also been considering the commercials for it. Branding is underway. We've been speaking with various companies who can create some casing and circuit boards for it to help us bring it to market quickly when we've moved it forward a little further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exciting stuff and not bad for only 2 working days worth of effort since that last post!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Digital Campus - DMC2 is go!</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digital-campus-go</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Following the launch of Barnsley's TechTown Action Plan: A Digital Campus, it was great to catch up with the working group yesterday morning down at the DMC.​&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Following the launch of Barnsley's TechTown Action Plan: A Digital Campus, it was great to catch up with the working group yesterday morning down at the DMC.​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-07-05-techtown-slide.png" class="img-fluid" alt="TechTown Slide" /&gt;
It was the first meeting we'd had since December but while it's been &amp;quot;quiet&amp;quot; for the group as a whole, there has been a whole lot of activity happening behind the scenes with individual parties!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not least of which is the design and delivery of the new DMC2 building - which Ben Hawley described as the most creatively name building anywhere in the world (or something along those lines). Haha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind DMC2 is that the Barnsley Digital Media Centre is at capacity right now in terms of being able to house new digital businesses . It's so popular as a venue in fact, that it even has a queue of businesses waiting to move in. Couple that with the businesses already in there growing and essentially, there's a demand for more space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, previously known as The Core, DMC2 will be refurbished between now and March 2020 with floors 1, 2 and 3 being growing space for the DMC. There'll be a large makerspace included, plenty of coworking / hotdesking space and it sounds like most of the building is already let to tenants!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited for this - especially the makerspace as you might expect, but also the opportunities the building will create for being able to talk to experts from other companies - to share knowledge, to work on joint projects and to truly collaborate across sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also looks amazing! There is a flythrough of the new design on Vimeo that was shared with us and the attention to detail in it's fantastic. The video is marked &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; right now, so I can't share it, but I hope to be able to soon.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>DigiDesk - the next iteration (v3)</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digidesk-next-iteration</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;​Having received funding from the &lt;a href="/20190121"&gt;Commercial Investment Fund&lt;/a&gt; for our work on the DigiDesk solution, we're introducing some design changes to create a version 3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;​Having received funding from the &lt;a href="/20190121"&gt;Commercial Investment Fund&lt;/a&gt; for our work on the DigiDesk solution, we're introducing some design changes to create a version 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaun and I spent some time with the Enterprising Barnsley Team, attending their series of Launchpad events. Based at the &lt;a href="https://www.barnsleydmc.co.uk"&gt;Barnsley Digital Media Centre&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.enterprisingbarnsley.co.uk/start-up/"&gt;Launchpad service&lt;/a&gt; provides a dedicated team who will support anyone in Barnsley who is looking to start a business, no matter what stage their idea or business is at. For us of course, DigiBook is an early stage prototype that we hope to sell and so we were keen to get a solid understanding of how the commercial aspects would work. They're events provide that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, having learned A LOT we've agree to revise the design of the solution a little further. It will still maintain the visibility of where busy and free desks are but it will now go a step further and identify who is sitting where which we hope will be able to update Skype and possibly SharePoint automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'll work by replacing the button on the device with a scanner for our staff ID badges. Simply touch your badge on the device, and it will register that desk to you until you scan your badge again. To incentivise us all to do that, it will also control the power sockets on desks too. When you take a desk, the power will come on (i.e. screens, docks, etc.). When you release a desk the power will go off. This offers some good savings opportunities on our electricity bill if nothing else, bearing in mind that every desks costs money every day whether someone is using it or not currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all an idea at this stage, so I'll post again as we get a working prototype of this going. Would love to know what you think in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>DigiBook is taking shape</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digibook-taking-shape</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Having succesfully trialled our visitor management system in the Town Hall, Gateway Plaza, Westgate Plaza, Smithies and the DMC, we've been working behind the scenes on getting it market ready - that is to say, sell it and generate an income from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Having succesfully trialled our visitor management system in the Town Hall, Gateway Plaza, Westgate Plaza, Smithies and the DMC, we've been working behind the scenes on getting it market ready - that is to say, sell it and generate an income from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We secured funding from the Commercial Investment board back in January to make that happen and since then we've been refactoring the code to work in a multi-tenanted SaaS (software as a service) environment, we've attended several Launchpad sessions and we've organised the design for its final form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That form factor includes a bespoke stand from RA Systems, fabricated from British Steel, powder coated and made in such a way that it can be adapted to be wall mountied, desk mounted or floor mounted. The original stand we piloted with is a little unstable we've found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-06-24-digibook-tablet-1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiBook close up photo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictured here is the floor mounted option with it's optional extra label printer that can be purchased as an additional module. The 10 inch tablet sits perfectly in the enclosure with space alongside for an RFID module that can also be bought as an added extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the innovation group this Wednesday, we'll be finalising the software design, applying branding as the Code Green DigiBook solution and then the sales and marketing work begins. We already have several potential customers lined up and of course our own buildings are already benefiting and have been for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-06-24-digibook-tablet-2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiBook full length photo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really pleased with how this has turned out so far.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Income Management System on Tour</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/income-management-system-on-tour</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we paid a visit to the Home Office, following up on our conversation about the potential of rolling out our Income Management System for use by other organisations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
			<guid>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/income-management-system-on-tour</guid>
			<pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today we paid a visit to the Home Office, following up on our conversation about the potential of rolling out our Income Management System for use by other organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Head of IT (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidrob2002"&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;) and I met with colleagues from the Local Gov Collaboration Unit (part of the Ministry of Housing, Culture and Local Government) and the Gov.UK Pay Product Team (part of the Government Digital Service) today - specifically &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bforben"&gt;Ben Cheetham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdamThoulass"&gt;Adam Thoulass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/egle_a_ieva"&gt;Egle Uzkuraityte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/katie-bates-a053b236"&gt;Katie Bates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MiriamAliceR"&gt;Miriam Raines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/richardblake86"&gt;Richard Blake&lt;/a&gt; joined via Google Hangout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-06-14-marsham-street.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Home Office building" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to discuss our vision for our &lt;a href="/20190531"&gt;Income Management Solution&lt;/a&gt;, how a rollout might work and how we might be supported with the collaborative aspects of making it happen. We're really proud of our software and we believe very much in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FixThePlumbing"&gt;#FixThePlumbing&lt;/a&gt; ethos. We just feel we need help to &amp;quot;get it out there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as the Local Government Collaboration Unit are running the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/"&gt;Local Digital initiative&lt;/a&gt; - a growing community of organisations working together with a shared vision to deliver more user-centred, cost-effective local public services through open, collaborative and reusable work - we thought it the best place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We co-signed the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/declaration/"&gt;Local Digital Declaration&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 which the initiative is drawn together around and we watched with interest as Minister Rishi Sunak announced the funding made available to provide training to all signatories and to support selected collaborative projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far 16 collaborative projects have been funded, one of which was a discovery into using &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/gov-uk-pay-as-a-viable-alternative-e-payment-provider/"&gt;GOV.UK Pay as a viable alternative e-payment provider in local government&lt;/a&gt;. One of the main findings of that project was that council's are in need of a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; income management solution and so we're in the right place and the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically then, we left the session with ambitious plans to submit a bid for funding in the next round that's anticipated to open in September of this year. Bids are most likely to be successful if they're are submitted collaboratively with other declaration signatories, have an amount of match funding included (which can be people) and have a solid plan for the outcomes they hope to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case then, we want to run a discovery project with other councils to identify what we need to do to take our income management solution from an internal Barnsley MBC product, to an externally available cloud offer that other organisations can sign up to and use with minimal impact and minimum cost - a plan that is aligned the ethos of the whole initiative and could provide significant benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, between now and September I'll be hopefully speaking with interested council's and working together with them to craft that bid. If you're interested, please do drop me a line or join the &lt;a href="https://localgovdigital.slack.com/messages/CJW65RNAY"&gt;#income-management thread on the Local Gov Digital Slack channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Council software backed for national rollout</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our local paper published a story about our &lt;a href="/20190522"&gt;Income Management system&lt;/a&gt; today and the potential for it's future rollout.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our local paper published a story about our &lt;a href="/20190522"&gt;Income Management system&lt;/a&gt; today and the potential for it's future rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing the conversation about our Income Management System, the Chronicle released an article today about it and its potential to be rolled out into other local government organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/council-software-backed-for-national-roll-out"&gt;The article&lt;/a&gt; is a little presumptious in it's title but correctly highlights that conversations are happening to see if we can make that a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we've spoken with several council's, the Gov.UK Pay team (part of the Government Digital Service) and in a couple of weeks time, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidrob2002"&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt; and I will be heading to the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office"&gt;Home Office&lt;/a&gt; to meet with colleagues from the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government"&gt;Ministry of Housing, Culture and Local Government&lt;/a&gt; - specifically in the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/"&gt;Local Digital Collaboration Unit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll post more about that afterwards but for now I'm very happy to be continuing the conversations and looking forward to seeing it all pan out.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Working in the open</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/working-in-the-open</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we held our first &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; show and tell session as a product team, demonstrating the features of our in-house developed Income Management System.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
			<guid>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/working-in-the-open</guid>
			<pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we held our first &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; show and tell session as a product team, demonstrating the features of our in-house developed Income Management System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="/20190102"&gt;blogged about our Income Management System before&lt;/a&gt; and how thrilled we are that we took the plunge and invested our energies into creating it. It's a fantastic solution that we're thrilled with and we're always happy to talk about it and sing it's praises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're used to running show and tell sessions around our developments - we've been following Scrum practices for a couple of years now - but those have always been with internal colleagues and so presenting externally yesterday was very different. As a remote Google Hangout, we couldn't see the people we were presenting to once we'd gotten started and that made it difficult to gauge the &amp;quot;room&amp;quot; and to tailor what we were saying. In hindsight, we ought to have had a second screen on standby to hold the main Hangout window, so there's a lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I think it went well and the feedback afterwards was positive. There were a good number of questions that I think we were able to answer and we've agreed to share &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4wWuZc1ZA"&gt;a video of the event on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. We'll also be creating a new &lt;a href="https://localgovdigital.slack.com/messages/CJW65RNAY/"&gt;income-management channel&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://localgovdigital.slack.com/"&gt;LocalGov Digital Slack workspace&lt;/a&gt; to hold further discussions as per a suggestion from Phil Rumens at West Berkshire. I'd like to use that channel to take more questions and to follow up in more detail - perhaps sharing some screenshots of the functionality we have now and how different scenarios can be played out in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily though yesterday was a fantastic opportunity to open our doors in Barnsley! The first step towards working in the open as per our commitment when we co-published the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/declaration/"&gt;Local Digital Declaration&lt;/a&gt;. What we're doing here is taking one of our flagship products and sharing it - firstly we did that with the Gov.UK Pay Product Team back in March and after a wonderful response from them, now we've done it with other local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our original on-site demo to the Gov.UK Pay Product Team came off the back of my previous blog post fortuitously landing in front of them at just the right time. &lt;a href="https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/"&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council&lt;/a&gt; had succesfully bid for monies from the Local Digital Fund and were running a Discovery project with them, the Publica Group (Cotswold DC, West Oxfordshire DC and Forest of Dean DC), Allerdale Council and Oxford City Council around the use of &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/funding/north-east-lincolnshire-council/"&gt;GOV.UK Pay as a viable alternative e-payment provider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that while carrying out their research they identified a common difficulty across local government in managing the income that a product like &lt;a href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/"&gt;Gov.UK Pay&lt;/a&gt; enables. After a few phone calls, a visit to Barnsley and some email discussions the output from the Discovery piece recommended that an Alpha project go ahead to see how our system might help resolve that - and so here we are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we'd love to see our system operating in a multi-tenanted Software as a Service capacity on the &lt;a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/"&gt;Gov.UK Platform as a Service&lt;/a&gt; offer, with the code available open-source and perhaps a cohort of local government colleagues holding responsibility for accepting/rejecting pull requests into its core. There's a lot of work to be done between here and there and that's where a funded Alpha project would undoubtedly help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hope that happens and in the meantime we'll continue to release new iterations of the product. We have 3 gaps to fill with regards to meeting the &lt;a href="https://12factor.net/"&gt;12-factors&lt;/a&gt; that Gov.UK PaaS requires and we'd like to consider using an alternative database to Microsoft SQL Server. The system is currently built in .NET but not Core as that wasn't available at the time we started - we see benefit migrating to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots to consider and very exciting times.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Barnsley software could support councils’ take-up of GOV.UK Pay</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/software-could-support-gov-pay-takeup</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="/20190522"&gt;Income Management System&lt;/a&gt; made it into the UK Authority's newsfeed this morning, presented as being a potential solution to increasing local government take up of GOV.UK Pay across the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
			<guid>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/software-could-support-gov-pay-takeup</guid>
			<pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="/20190522"&gt;Income Management System&lt;/a&gt; made it into the UK Authority's newsfeed this morning, presented as being a potential solution to increasing local government take up of GOV.UK Pay across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general gist is that as the GOV.UK Pay product team have researched what would be needed to make their solution the tool of choice for taking payments across local government, they discovered that taking money is only a part of the problem. An equally troublesome issue is what to do with money once it's taken. It turns out a lot of council's have difficulties with the processes of managing income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where our income management system comes in - potentially offering a solution where one is needed, more cost effectively than the private sector currently offers and at the best possible time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/barnsley-software-could-support-councils-take-up-of-govuk-pay/"&gt;The article&lt;/a&gt; generates some really positive kudos for Barnsley and I'm thrilled with it. Really proud of my excellent team and the fantastic work we’re doing. It’s great to think that our efforts could make a real difference for local gov colleagues and I look forward to continuing those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;​I posted recently about the rollout of our new digital &lt;a href="/20190307"&gt;visitor sign in/out systems&lt;/a&gt; in Westgate, Gateway and the Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased to report that despite a few teething issues early doors, they're being very well received. So much so that we've started attracting interest from several third party companies looking to buy them from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is great news and bodes well with our aspiration to eventually sell them and generate an income once we've squared off our costs, support and maintenance arrangements, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step then in our process is to make a start on having them become a real-world  products, not just prototypes. That means naming them, branding them, pricing them and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's naming them we'd really like your help with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to avoid using the word &amp;quot;sign&amp;quot; as a nod back to the non-digital process it replaces and any valid option will need to have a domain name available, but I'll worry about that - you don't need to. And I'm claiming Signy McSignFace now before anyone else does! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've any genuine ideas though for what we might call these things in the outside world, please leave a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Following my earlier post about the Innovation Group and the Commercial Investment Fund, you may might have noticed that in the reception areas of Gateway, Westgate and the Town Hall, these little beauties have appeared:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-03-07-visitor-system.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="System situ" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed, developed and testing by the council's innovation group, they were rolled out ahead of the peer review event that started last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very simply, they're iPads sitting in a locked stand, plugged in with a charger and restricted to only be able to present a single webpage. We've created that webpage to let visitors sign themselves in and out of our buildings. Each iPad is configured as to which building it is representing and so as visitors do use them, FM staff can see who is in which building in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-03-07-visitor-system-westgate.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="System in Westgate Plaza One" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind them is to remove the need for visitors to use those carbon copy paper books that we've had for a while now. At £65 a book, £55 a refill and buildings like Gateway going through several every month, the cost of a single iPad is very quickly returned, especially when they've been kindly donated by Paul Castle and the teams at Smithies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far then, feedback has been great and we've had a couple of requests from FM to add in extra features and tweak current ones which we're more than happy to do. We've also been approached by the WellSpring Trust who represent 19 local Academies and asked to add features that support their needs of such a solution. A local solicitors has also shown interest and we intend to talk to them shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also be rolling out to some of our other council buildings over the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-03-07-visitor-system-gateway.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="System in Gateway Plaza" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit for this goes entirely to the people who attend the fortnightly innovation group sessions and in particular to Dan Roddis who is the mastermind behind the coding on them! Sadly he leaves us shortly to take up a new post in another organisation, but we'll continue where he left off and make sure this solution prospers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in working on solutions like this, designing them, testing them, solving problems that you otherwise wouldn't get to in your day job - get in touch. The group is open to new members from across the organisation and meets every other Wednesday at Barnsley DMC. No previous experience is necessary, just a willingness to learn and an aptitude to Google the heck out of how to achieve somethings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll post again shortly about our plans for the electronic meeting room screens that took a slight change in direction yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
