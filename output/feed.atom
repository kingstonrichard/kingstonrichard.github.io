		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 2 concludes</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-2-concludes" />
		<updated>2019-09-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;We're making good progress mobilising our internal team to run &lt;a href="https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/09/12/the-6-projects-funded-in-round-2-of-the-local-digital-fund/"&gt;our Discovery project&lt;/a&gt; and in the interests of working in the open I wanted to quickly share some details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've engaged our internal Contracts &amp;amp; Commissioning team to support our application to the &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/"&gt;Digital Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. We'll be making use of the &lt;a href="https://digitalmarketplace.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/27/digital-outcomes-and-specialists-an-overview/"&gt;Digital Specialist and Outcomes framework&lt;/a&gt; to secure a Delivery Manager. Our intent here is to work with someone who is familiar with running discovery projects to both run this project and educate our team to be able to run future ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel to this, some of our internal team attended the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/agile-for-teams-course-description"&gt;GDS Agile for Teams&lt;/a&gt; workshop a couple of weeks ago and we're running a seperate Discovery project with them. Both of these exercises should give us a good handle on how to change the way we work for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've re-read through the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-digital-fund-prospectus-2019-to-2020"&gt;Local Digital Fund Prospectus 2019/20&lt;/a&gt; and noted the project outputs are due at the end of January 2020. That's 20 weeks from the date of the award. Assuming 4-6 weeks to secure a delivery manager, that leaves us up to 16 weeks for the delivery itself. I'm breaking that down as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 01-06: Procure delivery manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 07-15: Run investigative workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 16-20: Document outputs into reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously that will break down into a more granular plan over time, but that's the aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll share links to all of our documentation, starting with our marketplace requirements shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>£80,000 of Local Digital Funding approved</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-local-digital-funding-approved" />
		<updated>2019-09-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday came &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kingstonrichard/status/1172140492051636224"&gt;the official announcement&lt;/a&gt; that we'd been awarded the maximum £80,000 from the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/fund/"&gt;Local Digital Fund&lt;/a&gt; to progress the rollout of our income management system, nationally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4EPlTWphcculCRcoeXt-2leX4F8AGTL2XGG9sBE9P4"&gt;our bid to the fund&lt;/a&gt; back in August, on the premise that the income management function within council's was uncessarily burdened by legacy software products and that our in-house development could make a real difference as it has done in Barnsley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We proposed to spend some money investigating the claim that by allowing other council's to use our system they too could save time and money as we have - and that those savings, when scaled nationally, would add up significantly for the public sector as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money is effectively awarded to us on a speculate to accumulate basis - the idea that by spending £80K now, we can potentially save hundreds of thousands of pounds from the public purse overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, over the coming weeks and months we'll be running a Discovery project that will research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether there is a market for an alternative Income Management system to those legacy products already out there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are the user needs for a good Income Management product amongst local authorities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether our income management system meets the needs of other council's or have we built it too specific to our needs and set up - what do they need that we haven't thought about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether changes can be made to our income management system where gaps are identified in it meeting the user needs of other councils - what might those changes be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether our income management system can integrate successfully with GOV.UK Pay to offer a more holistic solution for accepting income and then processing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if an income management system could be built and shared within the public sector, what is the best way to ensure a cost-effective, well-supported solution for council's?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing this, we are the lead in a collaboration of 6 council's (Barnsley, Sheffield, Allerdale, Cherwell &amp;amp; South Northamptonshire, North East Lincolnshire and Huntingdonshire) and the GOV.UK Pay Product Team. There's also keen interest from West Berkshire, Hackney and Oxfordshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first step will be to recruit a delivery manager - someone familiar with running Discovery projects within the guidance set out by the conditions of the fund. They'll produce all the necessary documentation and coordinate research workshops with key stakeholders in our partner organisations over a 12 week period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect it'll take us 4-6 weeks to source that person and so we should be seeing results from the project early in the New Year. Watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>We've branded our "Digi" series</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digi-series-branding-ready" />
		<updated>2019-08-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who helped us &lt;a href="/20190402"&gt;name the first three prototypes&lt;/a&gt; that we produced in our Innovation Group. Digi&amp;quot;NAME&amp;quot; was the format we ultimately settled on, giving us DigiBook, DigiDesk and DigiMeet so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This naming format ties in nicely with our Digital First initiative and gives us a nice model to follow in the future. We're already working on a DigiSafe prototype and there are other ideas in the pipeline that suit too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, we set our friendly neighbourhood web designer Aidan Minton (who happens to be a qualified Graphic Designer) to work creating a branding proposal around the &amp;quot;Digi&amp;quot; concept and here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-06-digibook-branding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiBook branding" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-06-digidesk-branding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiDesk branding" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-06-digimeet-branding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiMeet branding" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of the concept here is that we can simply change the colour and &lt;NAME&gt; element to suit any new prototype we develop without needing hours of work to produce a new brand each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're looking next into the possibility of registering a trademark around the naming convention and securing domain names for any marketing / sales websites we might associate with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards and upwards!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>DigiDesk v3 is alive!</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digidesk-v3-is-alive" />
		<updated>2019-07-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Today we've completed the breadboard development of DigiDesk v3 and it works an absolute treat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPXpI4ZLL34"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/EPXpI4ZLL34/0.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Desk Occupancy Monitor v3.0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've set up a demo desk in our maker space at the Barnsley DMC with a keyboard, mouse, screen, desk lamp, and printer. Ideally we'd have had a second screen and a dock rather than a lamp and a printer but this represents a similar level of power usage to our typical office desk setup, so it's all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick scan of any council ID badge instructs the device to communicate with a central dashboard over Wi-Fi, register the desk as occupied and turn on the power to it. You'll see in the video that the screen, printer and lamp all kick into life. A second quick scan of a badge instructs the device to &amp;quot;de-register&amp;quot; the desk and switch off the power. You'll see that everything switches off almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of a lag with it at the moment which is due to the time it takes the device to register/de-register the desk, then re-check the status of the desk. It rechecks to make sure the registration has succeeded, as opposed to just assuming it has. If it were to assume it had when it actually hadn't, the device would end up out of sync and it would end up switching power off when it should be on and vice versa. We plan to speed that up though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we've been working on this, as I mentioned in &lt;a href="/20190626"&gt;my last DigiDesk post&lt;/a&gt;, we've also been considering the commercials for it. Branding is underway. We've been speaking with various companies who can create some casing and circuit boards for it to help us bring it to market quickly when we've moved it forward a little further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exciting stuff and not bad for only 2 working days worth of effort since that last post!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Digital Campus - DMC2 is go!</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digital-campus-go" />
		<updated>2019-07-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Following the launch of Barnsley's TechTown Action Plan: A Digital Campus, it was great to catch up with the working group yesterday morning down at the DMC.​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-07-05-techtown-slide.png" class="img-fluid" alt="TechTown Slide" /&gt;
It was the first meeting we'd had since December but while it's been &amp;quot;quiet&amp;quot; for the group as a whole, there has been a whole lot of activity happening behind the scenes with individual parties!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not least of which is the design and delivery of the new DMC2 building - which Ben Hawley described as the most creatively name building anywhere in the world (or something along those lines). Haha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind DMC2 is that the Barnsley Digital Media Centre is at capacity right now in terms of being able to house new digital businesses . It's so popular as a venue in fact, that it even has a queue of businesses waiting to move in. Couple that with the businesses already in there growing and essentially, there's a demand for more space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, previously known as The Core, DMC2 will be refurbished between now and March 2020 with floors 1, 2 and 3 being growing space for the DMC. There'll be a large makerspace included, plenty of coworking / hotdesking space and it sounds like most of the building is already let to tenants!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited for this - especially the makerspace as you might expect, but also the opportunities the building will create for being able to talk to experts from other companies - to share knowledge, to work on joint projects and to truly collaborate across sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also looks amazing! There is a flythrough of the new design on Vimeo that was shared with us and the attention to detail in it's fantastic. The video is marked &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; right now, so I can't share it, but I hope to be able to soon.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>DigiDesk - the next iteration (v3)</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digidesk-next-iteration" />
		<updated>2019-06-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;​Having received funding from the &lt;a href="/20190121"&gt;Commercial Investment Fund&lt;/a&gt; for our work on the DigiDesk solution, we're introducing some design changes to create a version 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaun and I spent some time with the Enterprising Barnsley Team, attending their series of Launchpad events. Based at the &lt;a href="https://www.barnsleydmc.co.uk"&gt;Barnsley Digital Media Centre&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.enterprisingbarnsley.co.uk/start-up/"&gt;Launchpad service&lt;/a&gt; provides a dedicated team who will support anyone in Barnsley who is looking to start a business, no matter what stage their idea or business is at. For us of course, DigiBook is an early stage prototype that we hope to sell and so we were keen to get a solid understanding of how the commercial aspects would work. They're events provide that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, having learned A LOT we've agree to revise the design of the solution a little further. It will still maintain the visibility of where busy and free desks are but it will now go a step further and identify who is sitting where which we hope will be able to update Skype and possibly SharePoint automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'll work by replacing the button on the device with a scanner for our staff ID badges. Simply touch your badge on the device, and it will register that desk to you until you scan your badge again. To incentivise us all to do that, it will also control the power sockets on desks too. When you take a desk, the power will come on (i.e. screens, docks, etc.). When you release a desk the power will go off. This offers some good savings opportunities on our electricity bill if nothing else, bearing in mind that every desks costs money every day whether someone is using it or not currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all an idea at this stage, so I'll post again as we get a working prototype of this going. Would love to know what you think in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Having succesfully trialled our visitor management system in the Town Hall, Gateway Plaza, Westgate Plaza, Smithies and the DMC, we've been working behind the scenes on getting it market ready - that is to say, sell it and generate an income from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We secured funding from the Commercial Investment board back in January to make that happen and since then we've been refactoring the code to work in a multi-tenanted SaaS (software as a service) environment, we've attended several Launchpad sessions and we've organised the design for its final form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That form factor includes a bespoke stand from RA Systems, fabricated from British Steel, powder coated and made in such a way that it can be adapted to be wall mountied, desk mounted or floor mounted. The original stand we piloted with is a little unstable we've found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-06-24-digibook-tablet-1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiBook close up photo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictured here is the floor mounted option with it's optional extra label printer that can be purchased as an additional module. The 10 inch tablet sits perfectly in the enclosure with space alongside for an RFID module that can also be bought as an added extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the innovation group this Wednesday, we'll be finalising the software design, applying branding as the Code Green DigiBook solution and then the sales and marketing work begins. We already have several potential customers lined up and of course our own buildings are already benefiting and have been for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-06-24-digibook-tablet-2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiBook full length photo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really pleased with how this has turned out so far.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/income-management-system-on-tour" />
		<updated>2019-06-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Today we paid a visit to the Home Office, following up on our conversation about the potential of rolling out our Income Management System for use by other organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Head of IT (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidrob2002"&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt;) and I met with colleagues from the Local Gov Collaboration Unit (part of the Ministry of Housing, Culture and Local Government) and the Gov.UK Pay Product Team (part of the Government Digital Service) today - specifically &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bforben"&gt;Ben Cheetham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdamThoulass"&gt;Adam Thoulass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/egle_a_ieva"&gt;Egle Uzkuraityte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/katie-bates-a053b236"&gt;Katie Bates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MiriamAliceR"&gt;Miriam Raines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/richardblake86"&gt;Richard Blake&lt;/a&gt; joined via Google Hangout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-06-14-marsham-street.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Home Office building" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to discuss our vision for our &lt;a href="/20190531"&gt;Income Management Solution&lt;/a&gt;, how a rollout might work and how we might be supported with the collaborative aspects of making it happen. We're really proud of our software and we believe very much in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FixThePlumbing"&gt;#FixThePlumbing&lt;/a&gt; ethos. We just feel we need help to &amp;quot;get it out there&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as the Local Government Collaboration Unit are running the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/"&gt;Local Digital initiative&lt;/a&gt; - a growing community of organisations working together with a shared vision to deliver more user-centred, cost-effective local public services through open, collaborative and reusable work - we thought it the best place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We co-signed the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/declaration/"&gt;Local Digital Declaration&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 which the initiative is drawn together around and we watched with interest as Minister Rishi Sunak announced the funding made available to provide training to all signatories and to support selected collaborative projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far 16 collaborative projects have been funded, one of which was a discovery into using &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/gov-uk-pay-as-a-viable-alternative-e-payment-provider/"&gt;GOV.UK Pay as a viable alternative e-payment provider in local government&lt;/a&gt;. One of the main findings of that project was that council's are in need of a &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; income management solution and so we're in the right place and the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically then, we left the session with ambitious plans to submit a bid for funding in the next round that's anticipated to open in September of this year. Bids are most likely to be successful if they're are submitted collaboratively with other declaration signatories, have an amount of match funding included (which can be people) and have a solid plan for the outcomes they hope to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case then, we want to run a discovery project with other councils to identify what we need to do to take our income management solution from an internal Barnsley MBC product, to an externally available cloud offer that other organisations can sign up to and use with minimal impact and minimum cost - a plan that is aligned the ethos of the whole initiative and could provide significant benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, between now and September I'll be hopefully speaking with interested council's and working together with them to craft that bid. If you're interested, please do drop me a line or join the &lt;a href="https://localgovdigital.slack.com/messages/CJW65RNAY"&gt;#income-management thread on the Local Gov Digital Slack channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Our local paper published a story about our &lt;a href="/20190522"&gt;Income Management system&lt;/a&gt; today and the potential for it's future rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing the conversation about our Income Management System, the Chronicle released an article today about it and its potential to be rolled out into other local government organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/council-software-backed-for-national-roll-out"&gt;The article&lt;/a&gt; is a little presumptious in it's title but correctly highlights that conversations are happening to see if we can make that a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we've spoken with several council's, the Gov.UK Pay team (part of the Government Digital Service) and in a couple of weeks time, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidrob2002"&gt;Dave&lt;/a&gt; and I will be heading to the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office"&gt;Home Office&lt;/a&gt; to meet with colleagues from the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government"&gt;Ministry of Housing, Culture and Local Government&lt;/a&gt; - specifically in the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/"&gt;Local Digital Collaboration Unit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll post more about that afterwards but for now I'm very happy to be continuing the conversations and looking forward to seeing it all pan out.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2019-05-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we held our first &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; show and tell session as a product team, demonstrating the features of our in-house developed Income Management System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="/20190102"&gt;blogged about our Income Management System before&lt;/a&gt; and how thrilled we are that we took the plunge and invested our energies into creating it. It's a fantastic solution that we're thrilled with and we're always happy to talk about it and sing it's praises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're used to running show and tell sessions around our developments - we've been following Scrum practices for a couple of years now - but those have always been with internal colleagues and so presenting externally yesterday was very different. As a remote Google Hangout, we couldn't see the people we were presenting to once we'd gotten started and that made it difficult to gauge the &amp;quot;room&amp;quot; and to tailor what we were saying. In hindsight, we ought to have had a second screen on standby to hold the main Hangout window, so there's a lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I think it went well and the feedback afterwards was positive. There were a good number of questions that I think we were able to answer and we've agreed to share &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4wWuZc1ZA"&gt;a video of the event on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. We'll also be creating a new &lt;a href="https://localgovdigital.slack.com/messages/CJW65RNAY/"&gt;income-management channel&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://localgovdigital.slack.com/"&gt;LocalGov Digital Slack workspace&lt;/a&gt; to hold further discussions as per a suggestion from Phil Rumens at West Berkshire. I'd like to use that channel to take more questions and to follow up in more detail - perhaps sharing some screenshots of the functionality we have now and how different scenarios can be played out in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily though yesterday was a fantastic opportunity to open our doors in Barnsley! The first step towards working in the open as per our commitment when we co-published the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/declaration/"&gt;Local Digital Declaration&lt;/a&gt;. What we're doing here is taking one of our flagship products and sharing it - firstly we did that with the Gov.UK Pay Product Team back in March and after a wonderful response from them, now we've done it with other local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our original on-site demo to the Gov.UK Pay Product Team came off the back of my previous blog post fortuitously landing in front of them at just the right time. &lt;a href="https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/"&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council&lt;/a&gt; had succesfully bid for monies from the Local Digital Fund and were running a Discovery project with them, the Publica Group (Cotswold DC, West Oxfordshire DC and Forest of Dean DC), Allerdale Council and Oxford City Council around the use of &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/funding/north-east-lincolnshire-council/"&gt;GOV.UK Pay as a viable alternative e-payment provider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that while carrying out their research they identified a common difficulty across local government in managing the income that a product like &lt;a href="https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/"&gt;Gov.UK Pay&lt;/a&gt; enables. After a few phone calls, a visit to Barnsley and some email discussions the output from the Discovery piece recommended that an Alpha project go ahead to see how our system might help resolve that - and so here we are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we'd love to see our system operating in a multi-tenanted Software as a Service capacity on the &lt;a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/"&gt;Gov.UK Platform as a Service&lt;/a&gt; offer, with the code available open-source and perhaps a cohort of local government colleagues holding responsibility for accepting/rejecting pull requests into its core. There's a lot of work to be done between here and there and that's where a funded Alpha project would undoubtedly help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hope that happens and in the meantime we'll continue to release new iterations of the product. We have 3 gaps to fill with regards to meeting the &lt;a href="https://12factor.net/"&gt;12-factors&lt;/a&gt; that Gov.UK PaaS requires and we'd like to consider using an alternative database to Microsoft SQL Server. The system is currently built in .NET but not Core as that wasn't available at the time we started - we see benefit migrating to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots to consider and very exciting times.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Barnsley software could support councils’ take-up of GOV.UK Pay</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/software-could-support-gov-pay-takeup" />
		<updated>2019-05-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="/20190522"&gt;Income Management System&lt;/a&gt; made it into the UK Authority's newsfeed this morning, presented as being a potential solution to increasing local government take up of GOV.UK Pay across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general gist is that as the GOV.UK Pay product team have researched what would be needed to make their solution the tool of choice for taking payments across local government, they discovered that taking money is only a part of the problem. An equally troublesome issue is what to do with money once it's taken. It turns out a lot of council's have difficulties with the processes of managing income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where our income management system comes in - potentially offering a solution where one is needed, more cost effectively than the private sector currently offers and at the best possible time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/barnsley-software-could-support-councils-take-up-of-govuk-pay/"&gt;The article&lt;/a&gt; generates some really positive kudos for Barnsley and I'm thrilled with it. Really proud of my excellent team and the fantastic work we’re doing. It’s great to think that our efforts could make a real difference for local gov colleagues and I look forward to continuing those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;​I posted recently about the rollout of our new digital &lt;a href="/20190307"&gt;visitor sign in/out systems&lt;/a&gt; in Westgate, Gateway and the Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased to report that despite a few teething issues early doors, they're being very well received. So much so that we've started attracting interest from several third party companies looking to buy them from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is great news and bodes well with our aspiration to eventually sell them and generate an income once we've squared off our costs, support and maintenance arrangements, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step then in our process is to make a start on having them become a real-world  products, not just prototypes. That means naming them, branding them, pricing them and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it's naming them we'd really like your help with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd like to avoid using the word &amp;quot;sign&amp;quot; as a nod back to the non-digital process it replaces and any valid option will need to have a domain name available, but I'll worry about that - you don't need to. And I'm claiming Signy McSignFace now before anyone else does! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've any genuine ideas though for what we might call these things in the outside world, please leave a comment.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Following my earlier post about the Innovation Group and the Commercial Investment Fund, you may might have noticed that in the reception areas of Gateway, Westgate and the Town Hall, these little beauties have appeared:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-03-07-visitor-system.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="System situ" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed, developed and testing by the council's innovation group, they were rolled out ahead of the peer review event that started last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very simply, they're iPads sitting in a locked stand, plugged in with a charger and restricted to only be able to present a single webpage. We've created that webpage to let visitors sign themselves in and out of our buildings. Each iPad is configured as to which building it is representing and so as visitors do use them, FM staff can see who is in which building in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-03-07-visitor-system-westgate.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="System in Westgate Plaza One" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind them is to remove the need for visitors to use those carbon copy paper books that we've had for a while now. At £65 a book, £55 a refill and buildings like Gateway going through several every month, the cost of a single iPad is very quickly returned, especially when they've been kindly donated by Paul Castle and the teams at Smithies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far then, feedback has been great and we've had a couple of requests from FM to add in extra features and tweak current ones which we're more than happy to do. We've also been approached by the WellSpring Trust who represent 19 local Academies and asked to add features that support their needs of such a solution. A local solicitors has also shown interest and we intend to talk to them shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also be rolling out to some of our other council buildings over the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-03-07-visitor-system-gateway.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="System in Gateway Plaza" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit for this goes entirely to the people who attend the fortnightly innovation group sessions and in particular to Dan Roddis who is the mastermind behind the coding on them! Sadly he leaves us shortly to take up a new post in another organisation, but we'll continue where he left off and make sure this solution prospers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in working on solutions like this, designing them, testing them, solving problems that you otherwise wouldn't get to in your day job - get in touch. The group is open to new members from across the organisation and meets every other Wednesday at Barnsley DMC. No previous experience is necessary, just a willingness to learn and an aptitude to Google the heck out of how to achieve somethings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll post again shortly about our plans for the electronic meeting room screens that took a slight change in direction yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Meeting Room Screens</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/meeting-room-screens" />
		<updated>2019-01-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;They're a little way off being ready yet, as we have a lot of work to do in finalising the control software and handling the touchscreen interfaces​. But, I'm very pleased with how the #DigitalFirst Meeting Room Screens are turning out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I took delivery of the first draft 3D printed case that I'd designed, thanks to our colleagues down at Central Library and their Ultimaker 3D printer. Many thanks to Paul Bennett for offering it up and to Rory Cooper for printing it for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-01-25-meeting-room-screen-case.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="3D printed case" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 'base' took around 14 hours to print and has columns to hold the internal circuitry that Andras Revesz is working on and a place to keep a square 9V battery held snug (the type you used to stick on your tongue when you were a kid). Sitting above those on the ledge will be the eInk screen (like in a Kindle) that shows room booking information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-01-25-meeting-room-screen-lid.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="3D printed lid" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lid, which simply snaps on and off, fits perfectly and locks the eInk screen in place. The idea is that will make it easy for FM staff to quickly move the lid and screen out of the way to replace batteries - which incidentally should last between 3-4 months we think. Having said that, we just found a battery that we think might last for 5 years!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the whole thing together here, with the screen in and get a feel for how it might look attached to the glass outside meeting rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-01-25-meeting-room-screen-whole.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Screen in the case" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect the final version will be black rather than red and ignore the logo... someone (&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; Aidan) thought it would be funny to put that on our test screen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan, Dan the website man that can worked up the actual design for how the screens might look when they're completed. The idea is that they'll show details of the current activity in the room, the one that's coming next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-01-25-meeting-room-screen-layout.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Screen layout mockup" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put that all together and you get this, kindly modelled by said Aidan Minton for us all to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-01-25-meeting-room-screen-aidan.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Aidan modelling our screens" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd love to know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The Innovation Group and the Commercial Investment Fund</title>

		<updated>2019-01-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday last week I attended the Commercial Investment Fund board with a view to securing some monies to progress three of our innovation group projects from prototype to product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commercial Investment Fund has been made available to support projects that are either innovative or have the potential to generate returns for the council. In the case of our prototypes, they do both in that they're innovative and we can potentially market them to other organisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting in the afternoon, I had 15 minutes to present our:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desk Occupancy Monitor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building Access Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting Room Screens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gave me only 5 minutes for each one and so I quickly briefed the group and took the opportunity to hand around the prototype devices we'd created so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased to say they were all very well received and I secured money for each one along with a couple of stipulations. The Building Access Manager has to be in place in Westgate and Gateway at least by February 25th and the Meeting Room Screens need a little functionality adding to help with our current culture of booking rooms and leaving them empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These can be easily accomodated and over the next few weeks we'll be rapidly progressing the prototypes and getting them rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a seperate note, we've also been asked if our Meeting Room Screens can be installed in the Library&amp;#64;TheLightBox to enable their agile approach to booking rooms. We're therefore now also working hard to meet the deadline there of the end of May ready for their June opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there are some great things happening. Three superb solutions developed in only a small number of day long workshops or hackdays as we like to call them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to be involved, if you have an idea you'd like to progress, check out the calendar of hack days on the innovation group sharepoint site and come down to the DMC reception at 9am. We'd love to introduce you to the group and get you involved. Obviously organise that with your line manager first.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>We built our own Income Management solution</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/we-built-our-own-income-management-solution" />
		<updated>2019-01-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;We recently took the decision to develop our own critical software solution, over renewing an incumbent contract. This is how it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying we didn't take the decision to &amp;quot;build over buy&amp;quot; lightly. We were in somewhat of a sticky situation with limited options. Ultimately, it was a good call and we're now enjoying the benefits, but there was a lot of nervousness given how complex a beast the function of income management is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I should briefly explain that for those unfamiliar with the inside of local government. It is precisely what it sounds like, but you might not appreciate that it presents a significant challenge in terms of logistics. Monies are continually arriving from a variety of different sources (citizens, businesses, partners, etc.) for many different reasons (taxes, fines, services delivered, etc.) via many different methods (cash, cheque, card, electronic, etc.) and through many different channels (direct debit, standing order, bank transfer, automated telephone service, etc.). Digital transactions happen quickly - immediately even. Physical cash transactions can be recorded immediately but not reconciled until days later. In any given hour on any given day there are potentially hundreds if not thousands of incoming transactions that need to be taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every penny of every single one must be captured, verified and validated to make sure we understand where its come from and why its arrived. Once approved they must be routed off to the right internal account(s) in our SAP system to balance our creditor records and to update other system records that we hold across our technology estate. Mr Smith has paid his parking fine and so it won't be necessary to issue any reminders, for example. It must all happen quickly, efficiently and correctly! Preferably, automated wherever possible. It's a huge coordination effort. The need for (and cost of) human effort should be minimised, as should any opportunity for processing errors to sneak in. With so many individual transactions occurring, even the smallest error carries a potential to cause big issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so as you might expect, software has a huge part to play in this 24x7x365 carefully choreographed dance. Up until recently, my colleagues at Barnsley Council had been orchestrating the operation very well, with the support of a suite of software products from one of the well-known major system suppliers to local government. My technical team had configured their suite into a streamlined work of art. They'd worked closely with our internal departments to define its various rules of validation, its steps of automation, its channel configurations and they'd fettled the whole thing to within an inch of its life. The situation was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good, but not perfect! It wasn't an easy task keeping on top of it all. We know that we weren't always using the suite to the best of its abilities. We weren't always squeezing the most out of it's potential. But even so, our experience of it was that the individual products in the suite didn’t necessarily play all that well together and our staff had to do lots of manual input and checking despite our technical efforts. It was often necessary to double key transactional data over several screens. Interfaces were unfriendly, seemingly designed c1995 and staff had to absolutely know their way around the suite in detail to use it safely. Strong training for new and even existing users was crucial and my technical team received a high number of service desk calls to &amp;quot;undo&amp;quot; mistakes on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That suite though had proven itself to be the best on the market for meeting our income management needs several times over. We'd had it in place for over 10 years, because it kept winning our tenders and being awarded our contracts. We outlined our requirements, we assessed systems against those and it kept coming out on top. The most recent contract it won was for a 3 year term, due to expire on the 31st March 2018. That carried with it a 6 month notice period (October 2017) for the negotiation of any changes, renewals, cancellations, etc. and so as we approached the summer of 2017, giving us time to spare, we instigated the necessary internal and external conversations around what should be our next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, over the months that followed we were unable to reach an agreement of terms with that incumbent supplier this time around and negotiations broke down. Having suspected that might be the case early on in the process, we acknowledged that we needed to be prepared for a position of either having to a) renew the contract on the supplier's terms or b) replace the entire suite of products with technologies that we already had available in-house! This second option was accepting that running a new tender exercise to bring in a completely new supplier with new software would be near-on impossible in the time available. And so we quickly set to work to see what might be viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I've blogged here before about how in Barnsley we're very lucky to have an outstanding software development team in our IT department - and once again here they were demonstrating their worth! By the end of September 2017 they had unbelievably created a proof of concept that was so good, it not only demonstrated a clear capability with our existing in-house tools but it also, (subject to suitable resourcing and a financial input) could be operational by the end of February 2018 - a whole month before the incumbent software expired! Stakeholder agreements were quickly sought, a business case was organised and suddenly the challenge was set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-01-02-income-system.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Income Management System - Screenshot of the transactions screen" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end solution was to be an in-house developed web-based product, created using the Microsoft Dot Net Framework, Entity Framework and SQL Server - as an organisation that primarily uses SAP and Microsoft technologies, this made for a great infrastructure fit and ensured it could be supported and maintained going forwards. Given the timescales, it would be a minimum viable product designed only to meet our current needs which were rapidly outlined. Extensions and add-ons would only be considered for inclusion later with the exception of a few key requirements that would enhance the income management function dramatically with relatively little extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, the council committed £50K (from its 2017/18 budget) to a 'replacement' project in return for what was expected to be a minimum £50K saving year on year from that point forward. And this was after taking into account any additional transactional charges that might result from the change. We cleared a path through some other planned projects and created an agile project team made up of key stakeholders from the IT development team, IT project management team, Internal Audit and Finance departments. Following a familiar Scrum methodology and using Microsoft DevOps (Visual Studio Team Services at the time), the team ran fortnightly sprints with goals defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To develop the outline software infrastructure and get a single self-service web form accepting online payments in a test environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reconfigure the remaining self-service web forms to take payments and route monies to internal accounts in that test environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To include all mediated web forms in that test environment and to enable transaction tracking, reconciliation and refund capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create reporting functionality, an admin portal for our Finance dept, installation scripts ready for launch and a security context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To launch to live a small group of self-service web forms and closely monitor, correct errors, tweak performance, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create the capability of transferring monies between internal accounts when corrections are required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To launch remaining self-service web forms to live and begin configuration of &amp;quot;basket&amp;quot; functionality for our contact centre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To complete and launch the &amp;quot;basket&amp;quot; functionality to live so our contact centre can take 1 payment for multiple services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To train key users (train the trainer) and rollout the solution to all stakeholders. Also increase coverage of automated testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To improve the transferring functionality as per feedback from the now live stakeholder group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To develop new credit note functionality as per feedback from the stakeholder group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To develop functionality to allow cash income to be recorded at PoS and accounted for when records arrive from the bank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To create routines for the migration of historic data from the incumbent system. Resolve minor needs from the stakeholder group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To launch the cash submissions functionality, migrate historic data and close down the incumbent software suite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To integrate with key line of business systems to reconcile creditor records and trigger workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that took us right up to the wire but by the end of March 2018 we had successfully moved from the previous suite of software products, over to our new single in-house solution. Sure, there were teething issues and since the end of the project we've run some follow up work to add in new features and resolve a few more minor bugs. We now see significantly fewer service desk jobs as a support team. Our staff are using a modern, responsive, well performing product that doesn't require double keying over several outdated interfaces. Every transaction is audited against SSO accounts and key integrations between the solution and SAP are established. We have strong integrations with our hosted Civica Enforcement system for parking, on-premise Northgate Housing system, on-premise Capita Academy system for council tax, non-domestic rates and benefits records and our debtors system which is SAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is loosely coupled with BarclayCard API's (it can be hooked into other payment providers easily) to take self-service and mediated payments and issue full and partial refunds. It transfers monies between internal accounts, manages cash and cheque transactions, processes nightly bank files FTP'd to us, churns through flat files sent to us by various partners including DWP, bailiff companies and AllPay amongst others before posting those to our SAP system. It allows staff in our Finance department to quickly search for transactions using various parameters and re-issue copy receipts either printed or emailed. Several third party websites integrate with it too including ones in our museums service and the national licensing management portal (ELMS) to take online payments. It also handles rejected direct debits files nightly from our bank, updating our various line of business systems as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're absolutely thrilled with it and in the fullness of time would love to open it up for other local authorities to consider using. We are though very conscious of the GovPay offer from the Government Digital Service (which sadly wasn't available to local authorities when all of this started for us - they were piloting with only a few select councils at that time) and we haven't yet decided how best to actually make it available. Should we open source it on GitHub or multi-tenant it and run it as a SaaS offer in the cloud? Perhaps if we open sourced it, others could work with us to turn it into a multi-tenanted SaaS offer? Perhaps other council's would just like to take a copy in return for providing operational feedback?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big consideration in all of this is that the risk of failure is now entirely ours. Procuring big software products from big software suppliers provides an element of security. It buys a comfort blanket through the application of penalties on failures. It transfers the costs and risks of ownership away from the organisation - all things we don't have the luxury of doing with our Income Management solution. Over the coming months that will need to be considered fully as a retrospective activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, and honestly, we're 9 months in now and enjoying the fruits of our efforts. Maintenance is minimal. Support calls are minimal. Change requests are... we haven't had one for 6 months. Transaction counts are up. Licensing costs are gone. Per transaction charges are about the same but I guess we can't win everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we've done here then is satisfied our business needs without external expense, made significant ongoing savings for the future, and potentially opened up what we see to be an opportunity to share our work collaboratively.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>The innovation group so far</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/the-innovation-group-so-far" />
		<updated>2018-10-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was invited to our Digital Leadership Team to present the progress we've made at the innovation group since it began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having set the terms and conditions of the group on June 5th, our first ever meeting was July 26th and we've subsequently then met every fortnight since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date that's 7 meetings, each one a day-long event and typically we've had between 3 and 5 attendees at them. People tend to drop in through the day as they can make it. Others pitch up early and stay for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At DLT I laid out the timeline of the meetings and details of the prototypes we've produced so far in a brief slideshow (I only had 15 minutes to present).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7 sessions, 4 products (see the slideshow for pics):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covert security camera (Birdbox)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building Access Manager (BAM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desk Occupancy Monitor (DOM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meeting Room Screens (MRS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have a list of potential future items still to start on. All of this is before we've really promoted the group around the rest of the council. There'll be people outside of IT, in other departments who have ideas they want to prototype and test. We hope to see them at a future session.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Iterating the desk buttons</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/iterating-the-desk-buttons" />
		<updated>2018-10-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;At the innovation group, in anticipation of seeing results from the workforce mobilisation theme of our Digital First programme, we've been busily beavering away with our Desk Occupancy Monitors - I've &lt;a href="/20180829"&gt;blogged about the first version previously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've come a long way since v1.0, having:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rolled out the devices on a pilot bank of desks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Captured actual usage data and anecdotal evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spoken with users and gathered feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built version 2.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 2.0 takes into account all of the points we've learned from the above and simplifies the devices further than they already were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2018-10-09-desk-button-v2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="v2.0 of the desk button" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They now only use one toggle button to change a desks status and have a single light that either blinks green when free or glows solid red when busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=movcK6mVciE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/movcK6mVciE/0.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Desk Occupancy Monitor v2.0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flashing of the green light is intended to help those with colour blindness distinguish it from red light. The red light also doesn't blink because it turns out the blinking annoys people. The earlier versions had a blue light that flashed periodically - we've removed that all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be adding new functionality to the system too so that desks can be booked from 6am each day via a website. The thinking is that you'll be able to sign in with your network account and select where you'd like to sit. This creates an incentive to use the devices on the desks if you haven't booked, to prevent anyone else booking them out from under you. It also creates an ability for us to use these devices for other resources such as meeting rooms, screens, etc. Gives us some flexibility in options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be demoing this new version at DLT later this month and we'll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Coding for low-code</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/coding-for-low-code" />
		<updated>2018-09-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;We're building our own low-code solution and when we're finished, we think we could open it up as a SaaS platform for other council's to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Barnsley, we're very lucky that we have an in-house web development team. They're the people behind &lt;a href="https://www.barnsley.gov.uk"&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt;, our eForms and our CRM amongst other things. They're responsible for building accessible, compliant solutions that meet the needs of our citizens and our departmental staff and they do that very well. I manage that team and I'm incredibly proud to say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today our website scores 94/100 for desktop experience and 100/100 on mobiles according to &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=barnsley.gov.uk"&gt;Google PageSpeed&lt;/a&gt;. It was &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-look-barnsley-council-website-aidan-minton/"&gt;recently overhauled&lt;/a&gt; with an 80% improvement in response speeds. We gave it &lt;a href="/20170915"&gt;progressive capabilities&lt;/a&gt; to function as an app back in November and we have more big plans for its future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now though we're focussing on our eForms. More than that actually. Our transactional platform. We're calling it our Digital Customer Service Platform (DCSP for short), and it will allow our customers to interact with us, anytime, from anywhere and by any means - beyond them just being able to read information on our web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've blogged before about just how big a task it is to &lt;a href="/20171115"&gt;digitally enable all of our 630+ business processes&lt;/a&gt; and we're very mindful of that. We know that if we're not careful, the more we develop, the more we'll have to maintain and in fact today we have a library of over 250 eForms that we manage individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we update our branding styles or tone of voice guidelines, we have to apply them to each eForm seperately. When we take on a new coding technique on a new eForm build, we don't go back and retrofit it to previous builds - who has the time?! When a new eForm is required by our departments, they have to wait until we've finished building an earlier one. And so we recognised last year that we needed a new, more sustainable approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DCSP to the rescue. It's designed to be a single platform into which eForms can be developed without coding. It can be deployed to our departments such that they can design, set up, test and maintain their own eForms. It controls the presentation of every one that's published to ensure accessibility and usability standards are maintained. It can handle multilingual outputs, validations and integrations with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course we have to actually code this thing first and that's an activity we started a few months ago. We've made some fantastic progress and already we're able to create new eForms, add fields, remove fields, amend fields, reorder fields, save drafts, publish versions, rollback versions and email submissions to departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fullness of time we'll be able to integrate submissions directly into departmental systems so they don't have to double key entries manually. We'll expand the types of fields that can be used from basic text boxes, textareas, radio buttons, checkboxes and file uploads to map location selectors, GPS locators, calendar date pickers, colour choices, multiple choice selectors, type ahead boxes, data driven fields, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in the cloud as a resilient SaaS solution, it will use an queuing mechanism to ensure citizens, residents and businesses can make submissions through it 24x7, 365. If any of our departmental systems are unavailable (down for upgrades for example), it will hold onto their entries until it's able to push them in, alerting support staff if a number of retries have failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will manage customer profiles, linking in seamlessly with an access portal through which personal details, service accounts (e.g. council tax), passwords, eForm submissions and responses can be managed, monitored and tracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submissions are where this gets really interesting though as eForms are only one access channel. DCS will treat them as such. Actually, submissions will be received through webservice hooks - making them available not only to the eForms, but also to IoT devices including the Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple Pod. But more... our own IoT developments will be able to use them too. Our litter bins can report when they're almost full. Our vehicles can report defects as they arise (or preferably before they happen). Our street lights and traffic lights can report their own issues. Our electronic rat traps can alert us when they've caught something - we don't have to keep checking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are endless. We recently learned that Land Rover Jaguar are working on a vehicle system that will identify potholes as their vehicles approach them and adjust the suspension of any colliding wheel to minimise the impact for the passengers. It will then tell any other nearby vehicles of the potholes location so that they can do the same. With our DCS solution, it could also tell us. It could report the pothole to us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a big ambition and one that has the full backing of our Senior Management Team and Digital Leadership Team. I proposed the original idea back in October of last year and secured approval to progress it into business case. With support from colleagues that business case was accepted in July this year and an amount of funding released to secure resources for the 18/19, 19/20 and 20/21 financial years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm obviously very excited at the potential of this. I'm also very willing to work with any council's who would like to get involved with us and help make this thing a reality. Our code repository is cloud hosted and open to pull requests from authenticated parties. There's plenty of scope to help speed up the build and plenty of opportunity for other council's to take advantage of the system for their own organisations. Do please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I'll continue blogging updates as we progress. We're running fortnightly agile sprints with planning sessions held every other Monday and review/retrospectives every other Friday. Our backlog is available within our source code repository and always open to new additions and ideas. I'll also blog about why we've chosen to build our own solution over buying one.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>An update from the innovation group</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/an-update-from-the-innovation-group" />
		<updated>2018-08-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Our desk occupancy monitor prototypes are built and ready to rollout after only three sessions putting them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been a lot of talk at work recently about hotdesking, particularly in the Workforce Mobilisation theme of our Digital First Programme. With that in mind our innovation group has been busy working up a prototype solution that can show where busy / free desks are in real-time, thanks to a great idea from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Paul81708531"&gt;Paul Bell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M49EzU3EnU"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/_M49EzU3EnU/0.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Digital Customer Services Platform" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since taking that video, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aidanminton"&gt;Aidan Minton&lt;/a&gt; has sorted us out with some labels for the units, showing that pressing the left button when taking a desk marks it as busy (red light) and hitting the right button when leaving free’s it up again (green light).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2018-08-29-labelled-device.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Pic of labelled device" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screens in building foyer’s and lift lobby’s can show webpages with live desk availability for the relevant floors. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedanroddis"&gt;Dan Roddis&lt;/a&gt; is working his magic on these just now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-29-plasma-screen.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Pic of plasma screen showing floorplate and available desks" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using simple buttons as opposed to, say an ID badge scanner, we’ve kept costs down and built-in anonymity. We can track usage trends across desks, floors and buildings but purposefully not where individuals are sitting / have sat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re hoping to pilot these devices over the next few weeks (PAT testing is booked for 9 of them tomorrow). The idea is for people to hit the red button when they occupy a desk for the day and then when they leave, hit the green one (they'll all reset to green overnight if that last part if forgotten). Once we’ve captured some data from them we’ll make some informed decisions about what to do next - hopefully vacuum moulding some professional cases, and printing some PCB’s. Equally though, the data might tell us that there's no value in them and that would be absolutely fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2018-08-29-desk-buttons.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Pic of 9 devices running side by side" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me this has a lot of potential as a solution and more so it demonstrates the value of the innovation group concept within our organisation and within local gov as a whole. Made possible with superb support from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DavidRob2002"&gt;Dave Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rileymarsden"&gt;Riley Marsden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cr8tveBarnsley"&gt;Tracey Johnson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.barnsleydmc.co.uk"&gt;Barnsley DMC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mattbrailsford"&gt;Matt Brailsford&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://barnsley.io"&gt;Barnsley IO&lt;/a&gt;, plus everyone who has been involved hands-on. It's been and continues to be a real collaborative piece of work with all kinds of people providing all kinds of input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT 31/08/2018: Chuffed to say these have now passed their PAT testing so we’re free to roll them out and start a pilot!&lt;/p&gt;
