/**
 * Media query mixin.
 *
 * It’s not great practice to define solid breakpoints up-front, preferring to
 * modify your design when it needs it, rather than assuming you’ll want a
 * change at ‘mobile’. However, as inuit.css is required to take a hands off
 * approach to design decisions, this is the closest we can get to baked-in
 * responsiveness. It’s flexible enough to allow you to set your own breakpoints
 * but solid enough to be frameworkified.
 *
 * We define some broad breakpoints in our vars file that are picked up here
 * for use in a simple media query mixin. Our options are:
 *
 * sm - e.g. mobile, which is default so no need to declare it
 * md - e.g. tablet
 * lg - e.g. laptop/desktop
 * gg - e.g. widescreen
 *
 * Not using a media query will, naturally, serve styles to all devices.
 *
 * `@include media-query(md){ [styles here] }`
 *
 * We work out your end points for you:
