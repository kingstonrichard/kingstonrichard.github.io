intro: It's been about 10 years since I completed any web development in anger and it's a skillset I'd all but lost until just recently. Along with electronics, building websites is a passion of mine and it's about time I rekindled that particular hobby.

I have such a passion for web development and electronics engineering that I can't even begin to put it on paper. 

I take such pleasure in creating something out of nothing using just computer code and hardware. It fills me with not only a sense of achievment, but of wonder at what I might make next. The ideas are always flowing - maybe I could make a motor that opens my blinds when I clap, a movement sensor that can monitor my house while I'm on holiday, a remote control car that my kids can play with, etc. 
I love the idea that there are no limitations beyond what I can imagine. If I can think it, I can build it. If I get stuck, someone, somewhere can help me as the maker and web development communities are infinitely supportive.

So, despite having left a career in web development for one of leadership and people management almost 10 years ago, I'm having a bit of a hobbiest revival. I've never lost the interest or the drive to enjoy making and so I'm going to get back into it - in as big a way as my working and home life balance will allow. My only other real hobby is mountain biking and over the winter I'll do less and less of that, so here's to soldering my fingers together instead.

This week I have already ordered a new Raspberry Pi, spent several hours in the evenings developing this blog, bought a few different magazines to help bring me up to speed as quickly as possible, and this weekend I'll be doing something creative with my son - I've promised we'll make a little robot with blinky lights from a toilet role tub, some pop bottles, a few led's and a battery. I can't wait! I'll post pictures.

Over the next few months I'll improve some of the code in this blog and use it to build up a library of components that I can reuse on other web development projects. It's already using ITCSS principles, is semantically structured and screen reader friendly which is great. I'm loathed to start building sites to order, but I do love the idea of creating something that other people can use. Maybe I'll think about that a little more in the future, but for now, it's all about refreshing my skills.

It's a short blog post this, but one that I'm thoroughly enjoying writing as it represents the start of me getting back to doing what I absolutely love. I have a hobby again, something I can focus on in my downtime when the kids are in bed, rather than idly staring at the tele or scrolling down my phone screen.

Looking forward to it!
