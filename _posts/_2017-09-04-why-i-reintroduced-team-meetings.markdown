Today I took the plunge and reintroduced regular meetings for my team. But let me be clear - I hate team meetings!

For years, whether I've been in them or running them, I've always found them to be forced. Booked in on a cycle just hoping that there'd be something meaningful to discuss when the next one came around. And if there wasn't, still sitting through them, seemingly finding things to chat about when most people would rather be getting on with their work.

My opinion hasn't really changed, but recently my environment has.

I now work in an office where people outnumber desks. Hotdesking has therefore become a necessity. Homeworking too. Holidays and sickness are essential in thinning out the numbers. But while it's tight trying to find somewhere to sit, so far no one has ever gone back home or ended up out in the corridor. Somehow, it just works and the benefits of being so flexible are absolutely worth it.

We're almost forced into modern agile working behaviours and practices. Everyone has a laptop. No one has a fixed asset of any kind. Project teams can move to co-locate when they need to. Friends can go and work in the coffee shop next door if they want to catch up while they blitz their admin work. People who wouldn't normally speak in the course of a day are getting to know one another. It's a different way of 'being' and I like it.

It does have it's draw backs though. Recently one of my team joked in a message thread "I think we might have a slight togetherness shortfall here" and on reflection he was right. As this new way of working becomes more prevalent, so too will the likeihood of us being seated apart on any given working day, resultant simply from the time we arrive in the office.

Hence the need for team meetings now. A social sit down if nothing more. Team performance is driven by working relationships. Working relationships are about trust. Task trust (to get the job done) and social trust (to know your colleague has your back). That together time is important both in developing and maintaining that trust.

So I had a choice of frequencies for these sessions - I could run them daily like an agile scrum, weekly, fortnightly or even monthly. I've opted for fortnightly initially and suggested we should do a round robin of what we've worked on in the last fortnight and what we're expecting to work on in the next, followed by updates from the top that I'll present and then any other business. A purposely short agenda. Purposely flexible.

The round robin will ensure there's always something to discuss. My updates of what's going on at the management level will keep everyone up to date on the latest strategic thinking. AOB will provide a chance for questions to be asked about those things, or for anything thats been frustrating anyone to be escalated and discussed.

The first session is soon. I'll post back my findings when we're a few sessions in.
