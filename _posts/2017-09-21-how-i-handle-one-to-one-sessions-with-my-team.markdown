When I became a line manager a few years ago, the biggest change that I had to
come to terms with was taking on a duty of care for other people, specifically
those who reported to me. Up to that point I'd only had to worry about myself 
and keeping the boss happy.

To have a duty of care over someone is a very significant thing that covers such
a wide scope of potential issues, from whether or not a person is happy, to have
I provided a safe working environment for them, to checking if the day to day 
pressures of the job are getting to them. It's all about monitoring their
wellbeing.

As we start to work more flexibly these days, carrying out that duty of care 
becomes more difficult. I naturally see less of my team (as they're out working)
and so I'm unable to hear the telling conversations they might be having, to 
watch their body language around other people, or to just pop by their desk with
subtle probing questions.

And so my 1:1 sessions with my team have become crucial, both for me and for 
them. Typically I'd have focussed on discussing their objectives and their 
progress towards them, looking for successes and highlighting areas for 
improvement. More so though nowadays I'm giving their wellbeing a once-over.

I do this monthly - and I maintain that schedule for everyone consistently 
whether I think their doing great, or are in need of some intervention. Where I 
think I need to take action, I do so by adjusting objectives for
the coming month, in such a way to deliver an improvement. The following month I
then test that.

Of course if there is an urgent enough need, then it'll become part of the 
discussion, openly and honestly, but on the whole this approach seems to work
well. We discuss how they're findings things generally, their specific 
objectives and how they're getting on towards achieving them, their current task
workload, any training they might need, their timesheet balance, how they're 
finding our team dynamic and any ideas they have for improving any part of
working life.

There's nothing overly scientific here, just a good repeatable way of keeping 
an eye on each person's wellbeing and tracking it over time. By monitoring and
understanding what works for someone vs. what affects them in a negative way, it
can then be possible to mould their environment around them, to get the best 
from them.

I'd love to know how other people are doing this in remote, flexible and agile
working environments, maybe spread out across a larger geography. Drop me a
line.
