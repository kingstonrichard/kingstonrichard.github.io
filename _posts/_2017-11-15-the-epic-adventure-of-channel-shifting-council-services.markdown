In England and Wales, local council's are delivering 986 individual services between them, each of which can be interacted with in up to 32 different ways.

From accepting applications, to receiving reports, to taking bookings, to processing payments, etc. there is a potential for there to be more than 31,000 different ways to handle requests from residents, businesses and visitors.

Of course not every type of interaction applies to every council service. It wouldn't make sense for example to be processing payments for abandoned vehicles. But we would legitimately expect to be taking reports about them and perhaps dealing with complaints too. There might even be status checks while we wait for the tow truck to arrive.

Very handily for us, the Local Government Association has put a lot of time and effort into developing a realistic mapping of these service/interaction relationships and making them available for us to review. They can be downloaded from the [ESD Standards](https://standards.esd.org.uk) website free of charge.

These mappings won't ever be perfect in an ever changing environment, but they do give us a strong insight into the challenge that council's face as they attempt to channel shift their customers online. Each mapping represents a real interaction that should be catered for in that access channel.

I say "should" because there will always be services that don't lend themselves to being online. Those that necessitate a face to face conversation in order to be effective - the delivery of certain adult or children's health care services spring to mind here.

That said, the LGA have included 1,830 mappings in their list covering interactions that will have historically (and currently) been accessed via face to face or telephony channels. The business processes underpinning them will be geared towards those and likely won't be in a good position to support a new online approach.

They certainly won't be digital processes for the most part (parts of them may be) and the staff undertaking them are unlikely to be thinking digitally by default. They'll be focussed on giving customers are good experience in the way they traditionally know how.

One thousand, eight hundred and thirty times, council's will need therefore need to challenge and consider:

* Adaptation of existing business processes to support an increase in uptake of a new online channel, and reduction of transactions made in person or over the phone;
* Development of new software solutions to enable customer self-service online, including the necessary security and information safeguards that goes with that (think login portals);
* Retraining of key personnel to ensure new online requests are processed quickly and efficiently, where possible streamlining and simplifying the approach using more technology;
* Communications and marketing strategies to actively encourage and incentivise a channel shift amongst customers

It may be possible to offset some of the cost of these efforts with the savings made where transactions volumes are typically high. According to the Society of IT Managers (SOCITM), it costs a council typically £8.21 to process a face to face interaction, £2.59 when that is handled over the phone and as little as £0.09 when the customer serves themselves online. Take a service running 100,000 transactions per year and the savings could be as much as £812,000 to reinvest.

And reinvest they will need to. As the development of each new online interaction comes to the fore, council's must consider:

* 

Considering that each self-service solution will have it's own specific requirements in regards to checking customer eligiblity, capturing the right data from them, following appropriate business logic, integrating into a back office system and ideally keeping the customer informed, the ask here on council's is enormous.

And this is where the question of buy vs. build legitimately comes into play. With such a long roadmap ahead, it's very tempting and somewhat obvious to look to the market to buy a ready-made solution. Something that can be quickly and easily implemented. 

Sales people will say that their solution is the fastest way to achieve these channel shift goals with minimal impact to operational staff. They'll show examples of where they've achieved great success and they'll demonstrate the art of the possible with their product suite.

What they won't say is that they too haven't delivered on the entire roadmap. Each provider will lay out a set of interactions that they've managed to deliver over the last few years which is great, but far from a complete set.

So what options do council's have. Do they go at it with their own software development teams (where they have them), keeping costs relatively low but taking a long time to deliver. Or do they buy from the market and achieve some quick wins, but then be tied to a specific platform to attempt to develop and deliver the rest. Or perhaps they buy from multiple vendors in the hope of piecing together as big as set of completed interactions as possible?

The truth of the matter here is that it's highly unlikely any council will truly achieve 100% self-service capabilities for their customers via any of these methods. Instead they'll focus on putting their most popular services online, relying on their phone contact centres to pick up the rest. They'll likely buy for this reason, to get to that point as quickly as possible.

But in this scenario "quickly" is a relative term. Business processes will still have to change, regardless of the method a council takes to achieve some self-service. Even ready-made products need to sit on top of prepared business process and so time will still be required to adapt those.
