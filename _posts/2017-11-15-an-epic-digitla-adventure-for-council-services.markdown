intro: Council's up and down the country share a common ambition - to offer a full and inclusive self-service access channels to their residents, businesses and visitors. That's no small feat to deliver!
---

There has been a long standing ambition amongst local government authorities to be able to offer their services to their residents, businesses and visitors digitally. As far back as 2003 there was an eGovernment initiative encouraging them to do so, to provide electonic access to their services, recognising the significant opportunity to meet rising customer demand and to generate budget savings.

It was estimated that by encouraging customers to 'self serve' on council websites, rather than walking into face to face settings, typical interactions with them could cost up to £8.12 less per time - multiplied over thousands of transactions per year, you get the picture. It was researched that face to face dealings attracted average costs of £8.21, while calls to contact centres came in at just £2.59 but via websites were only £0.09! Providing digital access channels, supported by a marketing plan to shift customers to them of course, made very obvious sense!

And so began a journey to design e-enabled versions of what were traditional paper based business processes, to publish those online, and to actively encourage their use. In the fullness of time it was forseen that public offices could be closed, staff in call centres reduced and monies associated with those reinvested to grow the 'digital' offer. So, 14 years later, why aren't we awash with seamless, integrated, accessible digital services in council's? Well, while it all sounds simple enough, its not quite so rosy in practice.

You see, designing a digital service can't just mean rehashing an existing business process to fit around some shiny new technology. It's not enough to just make adjustments to the current status quo and expect it be suitable or appropriate for the digital customer. To accept that our customers need something new has to be exactly that, which means us taking the opportunity to challenge what we think we know about their needs and to test our assumptions against them. What is it that they really need and whats the least painful way for them to get it from us? Does what we've offered for the last 20 years even satisfy them anymore? What could we do differently? Better?  And as we learn the answers to these questions, how do those affect our existing business processes? How do we maintain consistency in our levels of customer service throughout?

Then, there are the digitally excluded to consider too. A digital service can’t just be launched at the expense of the more traditional routes in, despite that being the quickest way to realising the savings potential available to council's. There will always be a need for mediated support amongst the less technically savvy. There will always be those who need a reassuring voice rather than a robotic message. Some customers simply won't adapt to new and emerging technologies. So in short, we're not entirely in control of our customer service offer. Good customer service captures the fundamentals of a great experience: ease, effectiveness, and emotion, regardless of channel - our customers decide how customer-centric we must be.

And so after 14 years it’s rather frustrating, although entirely understandable, that in Barnsley at least we’ve only managed to deliver a small proportion of the digital services that we ultimately must. The complexity in designing them and in the approach we've taken to doing that has energised some fairly lengthy pieces of work that, while effective in their delivery, have swallowed up months and even years time after time. Testing is often a very protracted affair and often times systems integrations have been amazingly extensive and costly. But all in the interests of doing the job right.

So, all of that said - accepting that digitising services is still the appropriate thing to be doing today in response to continuing increases in demand from the majority of our customer base, how on earth do we ever actually get it all done? If we continue the way we are doing, decades will pass and by the time we finish, there’ll be a whole new set of customer demands to cater to. Even now we're seeing the mainstream rollout of smart home devices, voice assistants, wearables and Internet of Things devices - these things aren't interested in business processes, just connectivity and API's. There has to be a new way of thinking!

# So, what do we know?

Back in 2003, to support councils with this, the Local Government Association rolled out an Electronic Service Delivery (ESD) Toolkit. Amongst other things, it provided a maintained lists of all the council services offered in England & Wales and the ways in which customers could interact with them. Today it recognises 986 services and 32 interactions that can be mapped together. Interactions range from ‘making an application’ to ‘reporting an issue’ to ‘receiving a benefit’.

Not all council’s deliver all of those services and not all interactions apply to every service either. You wouldn’t ‘Make a Payment’ (interaction) when ‘Reporting an abandoned vehicle’ (service) for example. Also not all service-interaction combinations are suited to being online – some homelessness services for example have to be delivered face to face.

In Barnsley, the offer includes 619 of those services and with an average of 3 interactions each. There are also some generic interactions that apply to all services, for example ‘Making a complaint’ which customers are entitled to do about anything. That leaves us with a little over 1,850 processes to digitise and publish.

We've employed two distinctly separate approaches in our attempts to do that as I suspect many other council's have too:

* Buying from suppliers:
  * Relatively quick
  * Introduces technical constraints
  * Changes can be expensive
  * Can require workarounds where functionality is missing
  * Includes support and maintenance
  * Doesn’t use up internal resource
  * To include ALL services means buying from MANY suppliers
  
* Building in-house 
  * Relatively lengthy
  * Can be fully customised
  * Changes can be made in-house
  * Core functionality can be amended as needed
  * Must be supported internally
  * Entirely uses up internal resource
  * Can be grown to include all required services in one solution

We’ve tended in both cases to focus on digitising small groups of services at a time, prioritised by usage volumes and political feeling at the time. That’s allowed us to make sure each process is designed well, built right and tested thoroughly which is important and we’ve been able to include bespoke integrations with back office systems too in most cases.

But, where we’ve built, we have consistency in terms of the branding, usability and accessibility of the services we’ve enabled regardless of the devices our customers are using. Where we’ve bought, we’ve been at the mercy of the chosen supplier to achieve those things. We find ourselves today with our customers using several sets of bespoke branding, needing many different login credentials, working with different accessibility levels, seeing inconsistent usability practices, having limited integrations between the services they’re using and we have no concept of a single customer record. I'll blog about this in a future post.

# Then, what can we do?

Well, isn't that just the question! It’s suggested that we take learning from the Government Digital Service and their approach with "Government as a Platform" to work up and implement a plan that will address the issues faced and offer full and inclusive self-service and mediated access channels to local residents, businesses and visitors containing all 1,850+ required service-interactions.

At the moment, my view is that we should look to develop a "Digital Customer Service" solution that should provide a customer portal, submission and tracking of all customer service-interactions with integrations to back office case management system where possible. I'd like to do that in one big hit, offering very simple interactions to begin with and then rolling out additional capabilities iteratively. Ideally those capabilities will then be taken up by individual business units who will use them as they see fit for their own business purposes - customising their own eForms.

If we can do that well, then it shouldn't be too much of a stretch to allow smart home devices and IoT devices to make use of that same solution - automatically submitting records as they need to. If we can tie into this a subscription model such that cases logged demand responses as they change, i.e. are processed, then we can enable a 360 degree digital service interaction.

This is of course is only me thinking out loud at the moment. Much work needs to be done on how we might achieve something that like, but right now I love the idea that it's a very different approach to anything we've tried in Barnsley so far. I'll update on this as I take the thinking further.
