## About the post

Aligned with our Customer Services Strategy, you will be working with other developers to introduce a comprehensive suite of digital services to our online presence, balancing user needs against business goals and technology capabilities. These will provide essential access channels for local residents, businesses and visitors to transact with us, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at their convenience and on the devices of their choosing. In turn, these services will help to reduce the burden on our contact centre allowing operatives to focus their efforts on more complex and personal interactions.

You’ll join our team of ICT Technical Specialists, sharing their responsibilities and you’ll use your extensive skills and experience to provide knowledge across the range of tools and platforms that they work with. You will be expected to lead in the development of the front end applications and web sites, developing great user experiences across different browsers and devices.
You will:

* Provide technical leadership across all aspects of the technology stack, demonstrating strong problem solving skills
* Use agile working practices, test driven developments and continuous integration/delivery with pair programming and code refactoring as required
* Maintain an awareness of website development trends and continually review and introduce new tools to optimise delivery processes and improve the quality of work produced by the team
* Apply your expert knowledge in design workshops with stakeholders, utilising emergent design principles and patterns to produce well-engineered solutions
