intro: Today, council's up and down the country share a common ambition - to offer a full and inclusive self-service access channel to their residents, businesses and visitors. That's no small feat!
---

There has been a long standing drive amongst local authorities to be able to offer their services online, digitally. Originally incentivised by a central government initiative back in 2003, they recognised a significant opportunity in doing so, to meet rising customer demand, generate efficiencies and reduce operating costs.

It was estimated that typical face to face service-interactions with customers attracted average costs of £8.21. By comparison, calls to contact centres came in at just £2.59 and self-service transactions on websites, at only £0.09. Providing digital access channels, supported by a marketing plan to shift customers, therefore made good financial sense!

And so a journey began, to design e-enabled versions of traditional paper based business processes, to publish them online, and to encouraging their use. In the fullness of time, public offices were closed, staff in call centres were reduced, investments in websites increased and today much progress has been made. But… one could argue not nearly enough.

While it sounds simple enough, redesigning business processes does not come easy. I won’t go into the where’s the whyfores (the GovUK Service Manual has them covered) but there is much more to it than you might at first think. People need to be retrained. Technology has to be implemented. Supplier and policy constraints must be overcome. Security and information governance arrangements require review. It’s a tall order.

Then there are the digitally excluded to consider - a business process can’t simply be put online and the more traditional access channels closed down - there will always be a need for mediated support amongst the less technically savvy of customers. There will always be those who simply need a reassuring voice rather than a “Thanks for your enquiry” message on screen.

And so after 14 years in this game, it’s rather frustrating, although entirely understandable, that in Barnsley at least, we’ve only managed to deliver a small proportion of what’s ultimately required. And in many cases, we’ve just gone out and bought a third party products to do it for us - to save time (though that comes with its own set of issues).

Accepting that digitising services is still the appropriate thing to do, in response to ever increasing customer demand and new emerging technologies (e.g. Smart Home devices), how on earth do we ever actually get there? If we continue the way we are doing, decades will pass and by the time we finish, there’ll be a whole new set of demands to cater to. There has to be a new way of thinking.

# So, what do we know?

Back in 2003, to support councils with this, the Local Government Association rolled out an Electronic Service Delivery (ESD) Toolkit. Amongst other things, it provided a maintained lists of all the council services offered in England & Wales and the ways in which customers could interact with them. Today it recognises 986 services and 32 interactions that can be mapped together. Interactions range from ‘making an application’ to ‘reporting an issue’ to ‘receiving a benefit’.

Not all council’s deliver all of those services and not all interactions apply to every service either. You wouldn’t ‘Make a Payment’ (interaction) when ‘Reporting an abandoned vehicle’ (service) for example. Also not all service-interaction combinations are suited to being online – some homelessness services for example have to be delivered face to face.

In Barnsley, the offer includes 619 of those services and with an average of 3 interactions each. There are also some generic interactions that apply to all services, for example ‘Making a complaint’ which customers are entitled to do about anything. That leaves us with a little over 1,850 processes to digitise and publish.

We've employed two distinctly separate approaches in our attempts to do that as I suspect many other council's have too:

* Buying from suppliers:
  * Relatively quick
  * Introduces technical constraints
  * Changes can be expensive
  * Can require workarounds where functionality is missing
  * Includes support and maintenance
  * Doesn’t use up internal resource
  * To include ALL services means buying from MANY suppliers
  
* Building in-house 
  * Relatively lengthy
  * Can be fully customised
  * Changes can be made in-house
  * Core functionality can be amended as needed
  * Must be supported internally
  * Entirely uses up internal resource
  * Can be grown to include all required services in one solution

We’ve tended in both cases to focus on digitising small groups of services at a time, prioritised by usage volumes and political feeling at the time. That’s allowed us to make sure each process is designed well, built right and tested thoroughly which is important and we’ve been able to include bespoke integrations with back office systems too in most cases.

But, where we’ve built, we have consistency in terms of the branding, usability and accessibility of the services we’ve enabled regardless of the devices our customers are using. Where we’ve bought, we’ve been at the mercy of the chosen supplier to achieve those things. We find ourselves today with our customers using several sets of bespoke branding, needing many different login credentials, working with different accessibility levels, seeing inconsistent usability practices, having limited integrations between the services they’re using and we have no concept of a single customer record. I'll blog about this in a future post.

# Then, what can we do?

Well, isn't that just the question! It’s suggested that we take learning from the Government Digital Service and their approach with "Government as a Platform" to work up and implement a plan that will address the issues faced and offer full and inclusive self-service and mediated access channels to local residents, businesses and visitors containing all 1,850+ required service-interactions.

At the moment, my view is that we should look to develop a "Digital Customer Service" solution that should provide a customer portal, submission and tracking of all customer service-interactions with integrations to back office case management system where possible. I'd like to do that in one big hit, offering very simple interactions to begin with and then rolling out additional capabilities iteratively. Ideally those capabilities will then be taken up by individual business units who will use them as they see fit for their own business purposes - customising their own eForms.

If we can do that well, then it shouldn't be too much of a stretch to allow smart home devices and IoT devices to make use of that same solution - automatically submitting records as they need to. If we can tie into this a subscription model such that cases logged demand responses as they change, i.e. are processed, then we can enable a 360 degree digital service interaction.

This is of course is only me thinking out loud at the moment. Much work needs to be done on how we might achieve something that like, but right now I love the idea that it's a very different approach to anything we've tried in Barnsley so far. I'll update on this as I take the thinking further.
