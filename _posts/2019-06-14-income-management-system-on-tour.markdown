[Dave](https://twitter.com/davidrob2002) and I met with colleagues from the Local Gov Collaboration Unit (part of the Ministry of Housing, Culture and Local Government) and the Gov.UK Pay Product Team (part of the Government Digital Service) today - specifically [Ben Cheetham](https://twitter.com/bforben), [Adam Thoulass](https://twitter.com/AdamThoulass), [Egle Uzkuraityte](https://twitter.com/egle_a_ieva), [Katie Bates](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/katie-bates-a053b236), [Miriam Raines](https://twitter.com/MiriamAliceR) and [Richard Blake](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/richardblake86) joined via Google Hangout.

We wanted to discuss our vision for our [Income Management Solution](/blog/council-software-backed-for-national-rollout/), how a rollout might work and how we might be supported with the collaborative aspects. Essentially we wanted to agree next steps.

Right now, the Local Government Collaboration Unit are running the [Local Digital initiative](https://localdigital.gov.uk/) which is a growing community of organisations working together with a shared vision to deliver more user-centred, cost-effective local public services through open, collaborative and reusable work. It was drawn together around the [Local Digital Declaration](https://localdigital.gov.uk/declaration/), which we co-signed in 2018, and it's supported by funding from MHCLG to provide training to all signatories and funding to selected collaborative projects.

So far 16 collaborative projects have been funded, one of which was a discovery into using [GOV.UK Pay as a viable alternative e-payment provider in local government](https://localdigital.gov.uk/gov-uk-pay-as-a-viable-alternative-e-payment-provider/). One of the main findings of that project was that council's are in need of a "good" income management solution and hence when they heard about our work, they wanted to know more.

We left the session with ambitious plans to submit a bid for funding in the next round thats anticipated to open in September of this year. Bids are most likely to be successful if they're are submitted collaboratively with other declaration signatories, have an amount of match funding included (which can be people) and have a solid plan for the outcomes they hope to deliver.

In our case, we want to run a discovery project to identify what we'd need to do to take our income management solution from an internal Barnsley MBC product, to an externally available cloud offer that council's can sign up to and use with minimal impact and minimum cost - a plan that is aligned the ethos of the Local Digital initiative and could provide significant benefit to other local authories.

So, between now and September I'll be hopefully speaking with interested council's and working together with them to craft that bid. If you're interested, please do drop me a line or join the [#income-management thread on the Local Gov Digital Slack channel](https://localgovdigital.slack.com/messages/CJW65RNAY).
