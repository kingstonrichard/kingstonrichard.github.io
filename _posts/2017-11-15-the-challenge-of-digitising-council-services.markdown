intro: Council's up and down the country share a common ambition - to offer full and inclusive self-service access channels to their residents, businesses and visitors. But how will they ever achieve it?!

There has been a long standing ambition amongst local government authorities to be able to offer their services to their residents, businesses and visitors digitally. As far back as 2002 there was an [eGovernment Strategy](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/document/national-strategy-local-egovernment-england-localegov) encouraging them to do so, to provide electonic access to their services, recognising the significant opportunity there was to meet rising customer demand and to generate efficiencies and savings.

This was most recently validated as late as 2016 when the [Society for IT Managers (SOCITM)](https://socitm.net/) published their [Business case for digital investment briefing paper](https://www.socitm.net/files/download/26) that noted customers 'self serving', rather than walking into face to face settings, could reduce typical interactions costs by up to £8.12 - multiplied over thousands of transactions per year, you get the picture. They'd estimated that face to face dealings attracted average costs of £8.21, while calls to contact centres came in at £2.59 and on websites were only £0.09! Providing digital access channels, supported by a marketing plan to shift customers to them of course, does make good business sense, despite the costs that doing so might incur!

And so over the last 16 years, likely longer than that if we're honest ([Barnsley Council's first website](https://web.archive.org/web/19980122135036/http://www.barnsley.gov.uk:80/) was launched in 1997) council's have been designing e-enabled business processes, publishing them online, and actively encouraging their use. It was always envisioned that in the fullness of time, some public offices could be closed, staff in call centres could be reduced and monies associated with those things could be reinvested to grow and further improve the 'digital' offer. But after all this time then, why aren't all council's already offering a full suite of their digital public services to their customers? Well, while it all sounds simple enough to do in theory, its not quite so rosy in practice.

You see, designing a digital service can't just mean rehashing a traditional business process to fit around shiny new technology. It's not enough to just make adjustments to the status quo and expect that to be suitable or appropriate to meet the needs of a new digital customer. To accept that customers need something new has to mean exactly that and council's must ask, what is it that customers really need and whats the least painful way for them to get that? Does what's been on offer to date still satisfy them? What could be done differently, better? The [Local Government Digital Service Standard](https://localgovdigital.info/localgov-digital-makers/outputs/local-government-digital-service-standard/standard/) suggests a common approach to delivering good quality, user centered, value for money digital services.

But as council's take the opportunity to challenge what they think they know, to test their assumptions and to improve their services, they need to do so not just digitally, but consitently across all their customer service contact points. That is to say that a digital service can’t just be launched at the expense of the more traditional routes into a council, despite that being the quickest way to realise the savings potential that's available. There will always be a need for mediated support amongst the less technically savvy of customer. There will always be those who need a reassuring voice rather than a robotic message. Some customers will never adapt to new and emerging technologies. In short, council's aren't entirely in control of their own service offers - their customers decide how customer-centric they must be.

And so, having worked in this arena myself for the last 18 years, it's frustrating, although entirely understandable, that in Barnsley at least we’ve only managed to deliver a small proportion of the digital services that we ultimately must. Of the 986 council services delivered nationally according to the [ESD Toolkit](http://standards.esd.org.uk/?uri=list%2FenglishAndWelshServices), Barnsley offer somewhere in the region of 630 of them but only have around 150 available online at [barnsley.gov.uk](https://www.barnsley.gov.uk) (and some of those aren't entirely digitised). The complexity we've found in designing them and in the approach we've taken to doing so, has energised some fairly lengthy pieces of work that while effective, have swallowed up months, if not years of effort. Testing has proven to be a very protracted affair and often times systems integrations have been amazingly extensive and costly. Engagement with indidivual council departments has ranged from positive to down right fractious - we've seen some actively refuse to change. 

So, all of that said - accepting that digitising services is still the appropriate thing to be doing today in response to ever increasing demand from the majority of the customer base, how on earth do we ever actually reach a point that all of our services are available digitally? If we continue the way we are doing, decades will pass and by the time we do eventually finish, there’ll be a whole new set of customer demands to cater for. Even now we're seeing the mainstream rollout of smart home devices, voice assistants, wearables technologies and Internet of Things devices - these things aren't interested in our business processes, just in their connectivity to us. While the "eGovernment ask" of us remains, there has to be a new way of thinking about it's achieved!
