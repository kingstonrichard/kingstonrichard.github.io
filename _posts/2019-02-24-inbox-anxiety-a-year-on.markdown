intro: Last year I worked out that only 20% of the emails I received during a weeks annual leave needed my attention when I returned. Is it the same 12 months on?

A year ago, [I closed my inbox for a week](/blog/i-closed-my-inbox-for-a-week/) while I went on holiday for the 2018 February half term. At the time I was feeling irritated by how difficult I was finding it to do my job against all the various pulls on my time during any given working week. It felt that I was supporting so many other people to do their jobs, that my own work was suffering. I was especially worried that while I was off for the week, their work would continue to pile up in my mailbox just waiting for me to get back. It meant my holiday wouldn't be a break - it would just be a temporary stay. I'd still have all the same work to do, but now I'd be a week behind and a bunch of it would hit me all at once.

So, I came up with the idea of using my out of office automatic replies to inform people that while I was on leave my inbox was too. Their email wouldn't be kept and rather they should send it to me again when I got back if it was still important by then. That would allow me to return to work fresh, ready and raring to go, without a mountain of work piled up, free of any "inbox anxiety". My holiday would truly be a relaxing holiday.

Whilst I told people that was I doing that, I actually kept all of the emails I was sent and when I returned I spent a bit of time analysing them. The upshot was that only 20% of all of them needed my attention. The rest were essentially just noise adding pressure to my workload that wasn't necessary. Could I extend that analysis out to my general working day and use it to improve how effective I was being - use my time in better places? Maybe.

It was defintiely an interesting exercise but I did later realise that it wasn't entirely fair on colleagues to take the approach I did of claiming my inbox was closed - I made a follow up post about that titled [Why I won't close my inbox again](/blog/why-i-wont-close-my-inbox-again/) which is worth a read.

To the point of this post though! I'm returning to work from the 2019 February half term holiday tomorrow morning and so I thought, a year on, why not review the situation again. Has anything changed? Have I chilled out a little since last year? I certainly don't feel as pulled around as I did so maybe something has stuck. Conducting the same analysis, here's what I received for the week:

* 25 subscription messages - mailing lists items I’d actually asked for
* 59 notifications from systems - alerts that I need to receive, for example updates from our change control system
* 3 recruitment agencies - blindly mass mailing people to drum up business
* 22 spam messages - companies touting for business mainly, not typical spam that our filters block anyway
* 53 valid emails - sent to me or had me CC’d.

So that's 162 emails received (down 29 from 191 last year) and 53 that are valid (down 11 from 64 last year). Of those:

* 18 were sent directly to only me - meaning they will most likely need some action to be taken
* 20 were sent to me and others - so potentially others will have responded to them already
* 15 were only CC’d to me - so I assume these are just for information and I can treat them much the same as I will my subscriptions and notifications.

That then means that at least 18 emails need my attention (it was 11 last year) and up to 38 might (it was 38 last year too). Worst case, of the 162 received that's 23%, so not much change from last year at all. A slight increase but that's still a lot of unecessary noise to be dealing with.

Just for complete comparison, I also received only 2 missed calls which is down 10 from the 12 last year). There were no SMS messages (down from 3) and no voicemails (down from 1) which is great!

Interesting to note if nothing else, but I think over the next 12 month I ought to be looking at taking some decisive action to try and reduce this down as far as possible.
