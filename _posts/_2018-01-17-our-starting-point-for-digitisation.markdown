intro: Digitising our council services is never going to be easy, but let's see where we're at already
---

A little over 2 months ago I wrote a blog post about [the challenge of digitising council services](./the-challenge-of-digitising-council-services/). In it, I questioned how council's are ever going to reach a point that all of their services can be accessed digitally. The process of creating even a simple e-enabled service is extremely complex, takes up a lot of time and council's have quite literally hundreds of them! I fear decades will pass before the ambition is realised and by then, there'll be a whole new set of customer demands to be worrying about.

And so I've been pondering on that over the festive break. I've been thinking about how we can make sure that every interaction opportunity with every single service can be digitised from the point of initial request, through to resolution of need in a timeframe that doesn't outlive me. 

at a very simple level considering the approaches that could be taken:

* Digitise each and every service one by one
* Group similar services together and tackle them as a 'family'
* 

The right approach though, as is always the case with these things, depends very much on the starting position. Where are we right now? What does our asset base look like? How many services have we digitised already? Can they be integrated? 


Thinking about how the Local Government Digital Service Standard](https://localgovdigital.info/localgov-digital-makers/outputs/local-government-digital-service-standard/standard/) has it right
