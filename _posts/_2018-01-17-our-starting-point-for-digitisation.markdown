intro: Digitising our council services is never going to be easy, but let's see where we're at already
---

A little over 2 months ago I wrote a blog post about [the challenge of digitising council services](./the-challenge-of-digitising-council-services/). In it, I raised a question about how council's could ever truly realise their shared ambition of providing electronic access to all of their delivered services. There are quite literally hundreds of them in each organisation and so, given the complexities of designing and implementing each one, we'd be talking about decades of effort to turn them all around. 

And so I've been pondering on that over the Christmas break
