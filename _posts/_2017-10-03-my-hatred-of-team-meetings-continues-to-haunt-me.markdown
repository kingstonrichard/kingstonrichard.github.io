Early in September, I reintroduced regular team meetings at work as a way to bring my line reports together at least once a month.

This was in response to us becoming ever more flexible and agile in our working styles, adopting practices including hot desking and home working more frequently. While we were always connected via Skype, email, WhatsApp, SMS, phone calls, etc. we were seeing less of each other in person. You can read more about that in [my earlier post](/blog/why-i-reintroduced-team-meetings/).

And once you've read that, you'll know that I hate team meetings. But you'll also know that I'm giving them another chance and that I promised to post about how they'd been going.

Well, two meetings in and I still hate them, but I think I have now figured out why. It's because my team resent them. They too have had the same bad experiences I have. The meetings break up their day. They have to break away to prepare for them. They learn only a few new things (that I could speak to them about during the course of any given day) and ultimately there's just no incentive to be there.

And it's their resentment that hangs over me every time we meet and I sit in front of them ready to speak. Minutes before the meeting I'll hear "Oh crap, we've got the team meeting again haven't we?" and those words ring in my ears.

The meetings *are* boring, I get that. They're a lost hour of productivity taking them away from that really exciting development project they're working on. Their value is limited to them.

So, I empathise with my team and I recognise that to get over that, to change attitudes and opinions about the meetings, I need to improve their format, the delivery of the messages and make them a place the team want to be. Over the next few sessions I'll be looking at how best to do that and trialling a few different options.

In the meantime, I will say that after the first meeting, I immediately changed the fornightly schedule to monthly. There was no way I wanted to inflict that experience on my team or myself any more frequently than that. That will hopefully change as I take things forward.
