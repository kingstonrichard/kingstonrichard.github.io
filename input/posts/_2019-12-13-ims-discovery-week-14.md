Visited NELC and interview them at their site - joined in remotely but tech failed us. Great outputs though.
Contacted Kirklees in response to their Twitter engagement to get them on board
Sheffield pulled out so only interviewed bradford
Had a partial survey completed by Warwick so followed up with them
Chased lots of councils
Recorded show and tell that groups all of my blog posts together
Poor take up
Chased key partners
Experienced lessons from initial meeting, i.e. get stakeholders lined up early - despite continual messaging
Ceremonies - lessons and learning
Reflected on our key research questions
