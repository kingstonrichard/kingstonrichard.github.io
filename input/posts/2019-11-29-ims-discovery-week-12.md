Things have kicked into overdrive this week as we aim to run our first user research workshop on December 3rd!

The sheer amount of activity lead us to introduce 2 new tools to our arsenal this week - Trello and Zoom. Trello used to list out activities and track who has been completing each. Zoom as a video conferencing tool to keep us in touch for daily standups and when urgent queries have cropped up. Great tool - connected with laptop, battery died, immediately connected up on phone instead. Worked seamlessly.

Our [Stakeholder Map](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwYo6Ak=/) highlights that the people we're keen to speak with cover the length and breadth of the country so grouped them together.

The first group is our northern group - essentially those closest to us.

Sharon and Mirriam have invited them to DXW's Leeds office as its the most appropriate space. Lunch will be provided. Had a great response with X attendees expected at the time of writing.

The workshop will aim to answer the questions from [the key themes we identified last week](/20191122). The format of the day and accompanying slides are being pulled together.

We started the week mapping out the capabilities of our Income Management System and it's limitations. From a Google Doc that Zoe and Debbie produced, Mirriam extrapolated out a Miro board that generated a number of questions to be answered. Some were technical queries, others were simply clarifying understanding and all of them helped to shape the questions that will be asked during our research, to answer our key themes.

In the meantime we've also issued two online surveys:

* Expression of interest - designed to capture details of interested parties who we don't yet have on our list - not so engaged councils - others not aware of the project
* Questions - designed to give us both quantative and qualitative data that we can supplement our workshop research with. Takes around 11 minutes to complete. All encouraged to do so!
